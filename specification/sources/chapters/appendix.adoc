[[code-style-conventions]]
=== Code Style Conventions

These are the code style conventions used in this specification to define
the API.

.Conventions
****
* Enumerants and defines are all upper case with words separated by an
  underscore.
* Neither type, function or member names contain underscores.
* Structure members start with a lower case character and each consecutive
  word starts with a capital.
* A structure that has a pointer to an array includes a structure member
  named pname:fooCount of type code:uint32_t to denote the number of
  elements in the array of pname:foo.
* A structure that has a pointer to an array lists the pname:fooCount member
  first and then the array pointer.
* Unless a negative value has a clearly defined meaning all pname:fooCount
  variables are unsigned.
* Function parameters that are modified are always listed last.
****

Prefixes are used in the API to denote specific semantic meaning of names,
or as a label to avoid name clashes, and are explained here:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===================================================================
|Prefix   |Description
|`XR_`    |Enumerants and defines are prefixed with these characters.
|`Xr`     |Non-function-pointer types are prefixed with these characters.
|`xr`     |Functions are prefixed with these characters.
|`PFN_xr` | Function pointer types are prefixed with these characters.
|===================================================================


[[applicationbinaryinterface]]
=== Application Binary Interface
This section describes additional definitions and conventions that define
the application binary interface.


[[structure-types]]
==== Structure Types


[open,refpage='XrStructureType',type='enums',desc='Values for type members of structs']
--
include::{generated}/api/enums/XrStructureType.txt[]

Most structures containing pname:type members have a value of pname:type
matching the type of the structure, as described more fully in
<<valid-usage-for-structure-types,Valid Usage for Structure Types>>.

Note that all extension enums begin at the extension enum base of
[eq]#1^10^# (base 10).
Each extension is assigned a block of 1000 enums, starting at the enum base
and arranged by the extension's index.
--

For example, if an extension with index 5 wants to use an enum value of 3,
the final enum is computed by:

[eq]#enum = enum_base + (enum_index - 1) * 1000 + enum_value#
[eq]#1000004003 = 1000000000 + 4 * 1000 + 3#


[[flag-types]]
==== Flag Types

Flag types are all bitmasks aliasing the base type basetype:XrFlags64 and
with corresponding bit flag types defining the valid bits for that flag, as
described in <<valid-usage-for-flags>>.

Flag types defined in the core specification were originally listed/defined
here, but have been moved to be adjacent to their associated `FlagBits`
type.
ifdef::backend-html5[]
See the <<index-flags-and-flag-bits,Index>> for a list.
endif::backend-html5[]
ifndef::backend-html5[]
See the Index for a list.
endif::backend-html5[]


[[general-macro-definitions]]
==== General Macro Definitions

This API is defined in C and uses "C" linkage.
The `openxr.h` header file is opened with:

[source,C,suppress-build]
----
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
----

and closed with:

[source,C,suppress-build]
----
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
----

The supplied `openxr.h` header defines a small number of C preprocessor
macros that are described below.

[[appendix-version-number-macros]]
===== Version Number Macros

Two version numbers are defined in `openxr.h`.
Each is packed into a 32-bit integer as described in
<<appendix-api-version-number-macros,API Version Number Function-like
Macros>>.


[open,refpage='XR_CURRENT_API_VERSION',type='defines',desc='Version of the OpenXR API',xrefs='XR_MAKE_VERSION']
--
include::{generated}/api/defines/XR_CURRENT_API_VERSION.txt[]

dlink:XR_CURRENT_API_VERSION is the current version of the OpenXR API.
--


[[appendix-api-version-number-macros]]
===== API Version Number Function-like Macros

API Version Numbers are three components, packed into a single 64-bit
integer.
The following macros manipulate version components and packed version
numbers.


[open,refpage='XR_MAKE_VERSION',type='defines',desc='Packs a three-component version number into a packed version number integer',xrefs='XR_VERSION_MAJOR XR_VERSION_MINOR XR_VERSION_PATCH XR_CURRENT_API_VERSION']
--
include::{generated}/api/defines/XR_MAKE_VERSION.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:major is the major version number, packed into the most-significant
  16 bits.
* pname:minor is the minor version number, packed into the
  second-most-significant group of 16 bits.
* pname:patch is the patch version number, in the least-significant 32 bits.
****

dlink:XR_MAKE_VERSION constructs a packed 64-bit integer API version number
from three components.
The format used is described in <<api-version-numbers-and-semantics,API
Version Numbers and Semantics>>.

This macro can: be used when constructing the
slink:XrApplicationInfo::pname:apiVersion parameter passed to
flink:xrCreateInstance.
--


[open,refpage='XR_VERSION_MAJOR',type='defines',desc='Extracts the major version number from a packed version number',xrefs='XR_VERSION_MINOR XR_VERSION_PATCH XR_MAKE_VERSION']
--

dlink:XR_VERSION_MAJOR extracts the API major version number from a packed
version number.
--


[open,refpage='XR_VERSION_MINOR',type='defines',desc='Extracts the minor version number from a packed version number',xrefs='XR_VERSION_MAJOR XR_VERSION_PATCH XR_CURRENT_API_VERSION XR_MAKE_VERSION']
--
include::{generated}/api/defines/XR_VERSION_MINOR.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:version is a packed version number, such as those produced with
  dlink:XR_MAKE_VERSION.
****

dlink:XR_VERSION_MINOR extracts the API minor version number from a packed
version number.

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:version is a packed version number, such as those produced with
  dlink:XR_MAKE_VERSION.
****

dlink:XR_VERSION_PATCH extracts the API patch version number from a packed
version number.
--



[[handle-macros]]
===== Handle and Atom Macros

[open,refpage='XR_DEFINE_HANDLE',desc='Macro to define a handle type',type='defines',xrefs='XR_NULL_HANDLE']
--
include::{generated}/api/defines/XR_DEFINE_HANDLE.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* object is the name of the resulting C type.
****

dlink:XR_DEFINE_HANDLE defines a handle type, which is an opaque 64 bit
value, which may: be implemented as an opaque, distinct pointer type on
platforms with 64 bit pointers.

For further details, see <<handles,Handles>>.
--

[open,refpage='XR_NULL_HANDLE',desc='Invalid handle value',type='defines',xrefs='XR_DEFINE_HANDLE']

include::{generated}/api/defines/XR_DEFINE_ATOM.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* object is the name of the resulting C type.
****

dlink:XR_DEFINE_ATOM defines an atom type, which is an opaque 64 bit
integer.
--

[[platform-specific-macro-definitions]]
==== Platform-Specific Macro Definitions

Additional platform-specific macros and interfaces are defined using the
included `openxr_platform.h` file.
These macros are used to control platform-dependent behavior, and their
exact definitions are under the control of specific platform implementations
of the API.


[[platform-specific-calling-conventions]]
===== Platform-Specific Calling Conventions

On many platforms the following macros are empty strings, causing platform-
and compiler-specific default calling conventions to be used.

[[XRAPI_ATTR]]
dlink:XRAPI_ATTR is a macro placed before the return type of an API function
declaration.
This macro controls calling conventions for C++11 and GCC/Clang-style
compilers.

[[XRAPI_CALL]]
dlink:XRAPI_CALL is a macro placed after the return type of an API function
declaration.
This macro controls calling conventions for MSVC-style compilers.

[[XRAPI_PTR]]
dlink:XRAPI_PTR is a macro placed between the ( and * in API function
pointer declarations.
This macro also controls calling conventions, and typically has the same
definition as dlink:XRAPI_ATTR or dlink:XRAPI_CALL, depending on the
compiler.

Examples:

Function declaration:
[source,listing]
----
XRAPI_ATTR <return_type> XRAPI_CALL <function_name>(<function_parameters>);
----

Function pointer type declaration:
[source,listing]
----
typedef <return_type> (XRAPI_PTR *PFN_<function_name>(<function_parameters>);
----


[[platform-specific-header-control]]
===== Platform-Specific Header Control

[[XR_NO_STDINT_H]]
If the dlink:XR_NO_STDINT_H macro is defined by the application at compile
time, before including any OpenXR header, extended integer types normally
found in `<stdint.h>` and used by the OpenXR headers, such as code:uint8_t,
must: also be defined (as `typedef` or with the preprocessor) before
including any OpenXR header.
Otherwise, `openxr.h` and related headers will not compile.
If dlink:XR_NO_STDINT_H is not defined, the system-provided `<stdint.h>` is
used to define these types.
There is a fallback path for Microsoft Visual Studio version 2008 and
earlier versions (which lack this header) that is automatically activated as
needed.

[[android-notes]]
=== Android Notes
Android specific notes for using the OpenXR specification.

[[android-runtime-category]]
==== Android Runtime category tag for immersive mode selection

Android applications should add the `<category
android:name="org.khronos.openxr.intent.category.IMMERSIVE_HMD" />` tag
inside the intent-filter to indicate that the activity starts in an
immersive OpenXR mode and will not touch the native Android 2D surface.

The HMD suffix indicates the preferred form-factor used by the application
and can be used by launchers to filter applications listed.

For example:

[source,xml]
----
<intent-filter>
   <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
   <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
   <category android:name="org.khronos.openxr.intent.category.IMMERSIVE_HMD" />
</intent-filter>
----


[[glossary]]
=== Glossary

The terms defined in this section are used throughout this Specification.
Capitalization is not significant for these definitions.

[cols=",",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Term |Description
|Application |The XR application which calls the OpenXR API to
communicate with an OpenXR runtime.

|Deprecated |A feature/extension is deprecated if it is no longer
recommended as the correct or best way to achieve its intended purpose.
Generally a newer feature/extension will have been created that solves
the same problem - in cases where no newer alternative feature exists,
justification should be provided.

|Handle |An opaque integer or pointer value used to refer to an object.
Each object type has a unique handle type.

|Haptic |Haptic or kinesthetic communication recreates the sense of
touch by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user.

|In-Process |Something that executes in the application's process.

|Instance |The top-level object, which represents the application's
connection to the runtime. Represented by an slink:XrInstance object.

|Normalized |A value that is interpreted as being in the range [eq]#[0,1]#,
or a vector whose norm is in that range,
as a result of being implicitly divided or scaled by some other value.

|Out-Of-Process |Something that executes outside the application's
process.

// the leading a is to make asciidoctor process this with asciidoc element styles
|Promoted
    a|A feature is promoted if it is taken from an older extension and
made available as part of a new core version of the API, or a newer extension
that is considered to be either as widely supported or more so.
A promoted feature may have minor differences from the original such as:

* It may be renamed
* A small number of non-intrusive parameters may have been added
* The feature may be advertised differently by device features
* The author ID suffixes will be changed or removed as appropriate

| Provisional |A feature is released provisionally in order to get wider feedback on
the functionality before it is finalized.
Provisional features may change in ways that break backwards
compatibility, and thus are not recommended for use in production
applications.

|Required Extensions |Extensions that must be enabled alongside extensions
dependent on them, or that must be enabled to use given hardware.

|Runtime |The software which implements the OpenXR API and allows
applications to interact with XR hardware.

|Swapchain |A resource that represents a chain of images in device memory.
Represented by an slink:XrSwapchain object.

|Swapchain Image |Each element in a swapchain. Commonly these are simple
formatted 2D images, but in other cases they may be array images.
Represented by a structure related to slink:XrSwapchainImageBaseHeader.

[[dedication]]
=== Dedication (Informative)

In memory of Johannes van Waveren: a loving father, husband, son, brother,
colleague, and dear friend.

Johannes, known to his friends as "JP", had a great sense of humor, fierce
loyalty, intense drive, a love of rainbow unicorns, and deep disdain for
processed American cheese.
Perhaps most distinguishing of all, though, was his love of technology and
his extraordinary technical ability.

JP's love of technology started at an early age --- instead of working on
his homework, he built train sets, hovercrafts, and complex erector sets
from scratch; fashioned a tool for grabbing loose change out of street
grates; and played computer games.
The passion for computer games continued at Delft University of Technology,
where, armed with a T1 internet connection and sheer talent, he regularly
destroyed his foes in arena matches without being seen, earning him the
moniker "MrElusive".
During this time, he wrote the Gladiator-bot AI, which earned him acclaim in
the community and led directly to a job at the iconic American computer game
company, id Software.
From there, he quickly became an expert in every system he touched,
contributing significantly to every facet of the technology: AI, path
navigation, networking, skeletal animation, virtual texturing, advanced
rendering, and physics.
He became a master of all.
He famously owned more lines of code than anyone else, but he was also a
generous mentor, helping junior developers hone their skills and make their
own contributions.

When the chance to work in the VR industry arose, he saw it as an
opportunity to help shape the future.
Having never worked on VR hardware did not phase him; he quickly became a
top expert in the field.
Many of his contributions directly moved the industry forward, most recently
his work on asynchronous timewarp and open-standards development.

Time was not on his side.
Even in his final days, JP worked tirelessly on the initial proposal for
this specification.
The treatments he had undergone took a tremendous physical toll, but he
continued to work because of his love of technology, his dedication to the
craft, and his desire to get OpenXR started on a solid footing.
His focus was unwavering.

His proposal was unofficially adopted several days before his passing - and
upon hearing, he mustered the energy for a smile.
While it was his great dream to see this process through, he would be proud
of the spirit of cooperation, passion, and dedication of the industry peers
who took up the torch to drive this specification to completion.

JP lived a life full of accomplishment, as evidenced by many publications,
credits, awards, and nominations where you will find his name.
A less obvious accomplishment --- but of equal importance --- is the
influence he had on people through his passionate leadership.
He strove for excellence in everything that he did.
He was always excited to talk about technology and share the discoveries
made while working through complex problems.
He created excitement and interest around engineering and technical
excellence.
He was a mentor and teacher who inspired those who knew him and many
continue to benefit from his hard work and generosity.

// see https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/issues/459
// and https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/issues/38
ifdef::backend-pdf[<<<]

JP was a rare gem; fantastically brilliant intellectually, but also warm,
compassionate, generous, humble, and funny.
Those of us lucky enough to have crossed paths with him knew what a
privilege and great honor it was to know him.
He is certainly missed.
