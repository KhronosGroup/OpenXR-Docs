--
include::{generated}/api/handles/XrInstance.adoc[]

An OpenXR instance is an object that allows an OpenXR application to
communicate with an OpenXR runtime.
The application accomplishes this communication by calling
flink:xrCreateInstance and receiving a handle to the resulting
slink:XrInstance object.

The slink:XrInstance object stores and tracks OpenXR-related application
state, without storing any such state in the application's global address
space.
This allows the application to create multiple instances as well as safely
encapsulate the application's OpenXR state since this object is opaque to
the application.
OpenXR runtimes may: limit the number of simultaneous slink:XrInstance
objects that may be created and used, but they must: support the creation
and usage of at least one slink:XrInstance object per process.

Physically, this state may: be stored in any of the OpenXR loader, OpenXR
API layers or the OpenXR runtime components.
The exact storage and distribution of this saved state is
implementation-dependent, except where indicated by this specification.
--

The tracking of OpenXR state in the instance allows the streamlining of the
API, where the intended instance is inferred from the highest ascendant of
an OpenXR function's target object.
For example, in:

[source,c++]
----
myResult = xrEndFrame(mySession, &myEndFrameDescription);
----

the slink:XrSession object was created from an slink:XrInstance object.
The OpenXR loader typically keeps track of the slink:XrInstance that is the
parent of the slink:XrSession object in this example and directs the
function to the runtime associated with that instance.
This tracking of OpenXR objects eliminates the need to specify an
slink:XrInstance in every OpenXR function.

[[instance-api-layers-and-extensions]]
=== API Layers and Extensions

Additional functionality may: be provided by API layers or extensions.
An API layer must: not add or modify the definition of OpenXR functions,
while an extension may: do so.

The set of API layers to enable is specified when creating an instance, and
those API layers are able to intercept any functions dispatched to that
instance or any of its child objects.

Example API layers may: include (but are not limited to):

* an API layer to dump out OpenXR API calls
* an API layer to perform OpenXR validation

[open,refpage='xrEnumerateApiLayerProperties',desc='Returns up to requested number of global layer properties',type='protos',xrefs='XrApiLayerProperties']
--
To determine what set of API layers are available, OpenXR provides the
flink:xrEnumerateApiLayerProperties function:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrEnumerateApiLayerProperties.adoc[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:propertyCapacityInput is the capacity of the pname:properties array,
  or 0 to indicate a request to retrieve the required capacity.
* pname:propertyCountOutput is a pointer to the count of pname:properties
  written, or a pointer to the required capacity in the case that
  pname:propertyCapacityInput is insufficient.
* pname:properties is a pointer to an array of slink:XrApiLayerProperties
  structures, but can: be code:NULL if pname:propertyCapacityInput is 0.
* See the <<fundamentals-buffer-size-parameters>> section for a detailed
  description of retrieving the required pname:properties size.
****

The list of available layers may change at any time due to actions outside
of the OpenXR runtime, so two calls to flink:xrEnumerateApiLayerProperties
with the same parameters may: return different results, or retrieve
different pname:propertyCountOutput values or pname:properties contents.

Once an instance has been created, the layers enabled for that instance will
continue to be enabled and valid for the lifetime of that instance, even if
some of them become unavailable for future instances.

The slink:XrApiLayerProperties structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrApiLayerProperties.adoc[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR.
* pname:layerName is a string specifying the name of the API layer.
  Use this name in the
  slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo::pname:enabledApiLayerNames array to enable
  this API layer for an instance.
* pname:specVersion is the API version the API layer was written to, encoded
  as described in the <<fundamentals-api-version-numbers-and-semantics>>
  section.
* pname:layerVersion is the version of this API layer.
  It is an integer, increasing with backward compatible changes.
* pname:description is a string providing additional details that can: be
  used by the application to identify the API layer.
****

include::{generated}/validity/structs/XrApiLayerProperties.adoc[]
--

To enable a layer, the name of the layer should: be added to
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo::pname:enabledApiLayerNames when creating an
slink:XrInstance.

Loader implementations may: provide mechanisms outside this API for enabling
specific API layers.
API layers enabled through such a mechanism are implicitly enabled, while
API layers enabled by including the API layer name in
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo::pname:enabledApiLayerNames are explicitly
enabled.
Except where otherwise specified, implicitly enabled and explicitly enabled
API layers differ only in the way they are enabled.
Explicitly enabling an API layer that is implicitly enabled has no
additional effect.

Instance extensions are able to affect the operation of the instance and any
of its child objects.
As stated <<fundamentals-extensions, earlier>>, extensions can expand the
OpenXR API and provide new functions or augment behavior.

Examples of extensions may: be (but are not limited to):

.Extension Examples
****
* an extension to include OpenXR functions to work with a new graphics API
* an extension to expose debug information via a callback
****

[open,refpage='xrEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties',desc='Returns properties of available instance extensions',type='protos']
--

The application can determine the available instance extensions by calling
flink:xrEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties.adoc[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:layerName is either code:NULL or a pointer to a string naming the
  API layer to retrieve extensions from, as returned by
  flink:xrEnumerateApiLayerProperties.
* pname:propertyCapacityInput is the capacity of the pname:properties array,
  or `0` to indicate a request to retrieve the required capacity.
* pname:propertyCountOutput is a pointer to the count of pname:properties
  written, or a pointer to the required capacity in the case that
  pname:propertyCapacityInput is insufficient.
* pname:properties is a pointer to an array of slink:XrExtensionProperties
  structures, but can: be code:NULL if pname:propertyCapacityInput is `0`.
* See the <<fundamentals-buffer-size-parameters>> section for a detailed
  description of retrieving the required pname:properties size.
****

Because the list of available layers may change externally between calls to
flink:xrEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties, two calls may: retrieve
different results if a pname:layerName is available in one call but not in
another.
The extensions supported by a layer may also change between two calls, e.g.
if the layer implementation is replaced by a different version between those
calls, or if an `XrInstance` is created or destroyed between those calls.

This function may: be called before an instance has been created;
implementations must: not assume an instance exists.

When applications invoke this function, the OpenXR loader's implementation
is used, which enumerates the registered runtime and API layer manifests;
this function must: still be implemented by API layers and runtimes, as it may
be invoked by API layers.

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:createInfo points to an instance of slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo
  controlling creation of the instance.
* pname:instance points to an slink:XrInstance handle in which the resulting
  instance is returned.
****

flink:xrCreateInstance creates the slink:XrInstance, then enables and
initializes global API layers and extensions requested by the application.
If an extension is provided by an API layer, both the API layer and
extension must: be specified at flink:xrCreateInstance time.
If a specified API layer cannot be found, no slink:XrInstance will be
created and the function will return ename:XR_ERROR_API_LAYER_NOT_PRESENT.
Likewise, if a specified extension cannot be found, the call must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_EXTENSION_NOT_PRESENT and no slink:XrInstance will be
created.
Additionally, some runtimes may: limit the number of concurrent instances
that may be in use.
If the application attempts to create more instances than a runtime can
simultaneously support, flink:xrCreateInstance may: return
ename:XR_ERROR_LIMIT_REACHED.

If the slink:XrApplicationInfo::pname:applicationName is the empty string
the runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_NAME_INVALID.

If the slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo structure contains a platform-specific
extension for a platform other than the target platform,
ename:XR_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED may: be returned.
If a mandatory platform-specific extension is defined for the target
platform but no matching extension struct is provided in
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
When using the OpenXR API to implement a reusable engine that will be used
by many applications, pname:engineName should: be set to a unique string
that identifies the engine, and pname:engineVersion should: encode a
representation of the engine's version.
This way, all applications that share this engine version will provide the
same pname:engineName and pname:engineVersion to the runtime.
The engine should: then enable individual applications to choose their
specific pname:applicationName and pname:applicationVersion, enabling one
application to be distinguished from another application.

When using the OpenXR API to implement an individual application without a
shared engine, the input pname:engineName should: be left empty and
pname:engineVersion should: be set to 0.
The pname:applicationName should: then be filled in with a unique string
that identifies the app and the pname:applicationVersion should: encode a
representation of the application's version.

[[instance-platform-specific-creation]]
=== Platform-Specific Instance Creation

Some amount of data required for instance creation is exposed through
chained structures defined in extensions.
These structures may be optional: or even required: for instance creation on
specific platforms, but not on other platforms.
Separating off platform-specific functionality into extension structures
prevents the primary slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo structure from becoming too
bloated with unnecessary information.

See the
ifndef::HAS_DEPRECATED_EXTENSIONS[]
<<extension-appendices-list, List of Extensions>>
endif::HAS_DEPRECATED_EXTENSIONS[]
ifdef::HAS_DEPRECATED_EXTENSIONS[]
<<extension-appendices-list, List of Current Extensions>>
endif::HAS_DEPRECATED_EXTENSIONS[]
appendix for the list of available extensions and their related structures.
These structures expand the slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo parent struct using
the slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo::pname:next member.
The specific list of structures that may be used for extending
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo::pname:next can be found in the "Valid Usage
(Implicit)" block immediately following the definition of the structure.

[[instance-lost]]
==== The Instance Lost Error

The ename:XR_ERROR_INSTANCE_LOST error indicates that the slink:XrInstance
has become unusable.
This can: happen if a critical runtime process aborts, if the connection to
the runtime is otherwise no longer available, or if the runtime encounters
an error during any function execution which prevents it from being able to
support further function execution.
Once ename:XR_ERROR_INSTANCE_LOST is first returned, it must: henceforth be
returned by all non-destroy functions that involve an slink:XrInstance or
child handle type until the instance is destroyed.
Applications must: destroy the slink:XrInstance.
Applications may: then attempt to continue by recreating all relevant OpenXR
objects, starting with a new slink:XrInstance.
A runtime may: generate an slink:XrEventDataInstanceLossPending event when
instance loss is detected.

==== XrEventDataInstanceLossPending

--
The slink:XrEventDataInstanceLossPending structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrEventDataInstanceLossPending.adoc[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR.
* pname:lossTime is the absolute time at which the indicated instance will
  be considered lost and become unusable.
****

Receiving the slink:XrEventDataInstanceLossPending event structure indicates
that the application is about to lose the indicated slink:XrInstance at the
indicated pname:lossTime in the future.
The application should call flink:xrDestroyInstance and relinquish any
instance-specific resources.
This typically occurs to make way for a replacement of the underlying
runtime, such as via a software update.

After the application has destroyed all of its instances and their children
and waited past the specified time, it may then re-try
flink:xrCreateInstance in a loop waiting for whatever maintenance the
runtime is performing to complete.
The runtime will return ename:XR_ERROR_RUNTIME_UNAVAILABLE from
flink:xrCreateInstance as long as it is unable to create the instance.
Once the runtime has returned and is able to continue, it must: resume
returning ename:XR_SUCCESS from flink:xrCreateInstance if valid data is
passed in.

=== Instance Enumerated Type String Functions

strings for use in log messages, to be localized in UI, or for various other
reasons.
