*Overview*

This extension enables the use of the OpenGL graphics API in an OpenXR runtime.
Without this extension, the OpenXR runtime may not be able to
use any OpenGL swapchain images.

This extension provides the mechanisms necessary for an application to generate a
valid stext:XrGraphicsBindingOpenGL*KHR structure in order to create a
OpenGL-based slink:XrSession.
Note that during this process the application is responsible for creating all
the required OpenGL objects,
including an OpenGL context to be used for rendering.

This extension also provides mechanisms for the application to interact with
images acquired by calling flink:xrEnumerateSwapchainImages.

In order to expose the structures, types, and functions of this extension,
you must: define
dlink:XR_USE_GRAPHICS_API_OPENGL, as well as an appropriate
<<window-system-header-control,window system define>> supported by this extension,
before including the OpenXR platform header `openxr_platform.h`,
in all portions of your library or application that include it.
The window system defines currently supported by this extension are:

* dlink:XR_USE_PLATFORM_WIN32
* dlink:XR_USE_PLATFORM_XLIB
* dlink:XR_USE_PLATFORM_XCB
* dlink:XR_USE_PLATFORM_WAYLAND

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_GRAPHICS_REQUIREMENTS_OPENGL_KHR
* ename:XR_TYPE_GRAPHICS_BINDING_OPENGL_WIN32_KHR
* ename:XR_TYPE_GRAPHICS_BINDING_OPENGL_XLIB_KHR
* ename:XR_TYPE_GRAPHICS_BINDING_OPENGL_XCB_KHR
* ename:XR_TYPE_GRAPHICS_BINDING_OPENGL_WAYLAND_KHR
* ename:XR_TYPE_SWAPCHAIN_IMAGE_OPENGL_KHR

*New Enums*

*New Structures*

The following structures are provided to supply supporting runtimes the
necessary information required to work with the OpenGL API executing on
certain operating systems.

These structures are only available when the corresponding
`XR_USE_PLATFORM_` macro is defined before including `openxr_platform.h`.

slink:XrSessionCreateInfo.

dlink:XR_USE_PLATFORM_WIN32.

If a given session was created with a stext:XrGraphicsBindingOpenGL*KHR,
the following conditions must: apply.

* Calls to flink:xrEnumerateSwapchainImages on an slink:XrSwapchain in that session
  must: return an array of slink:XrSwapchainImageOpenGLKHR structures.
* Whenever an OpenXR function accepts an slink:XrSwapchainImageBaseHeader pointer
  as a parameter in that session, the runtime must: also accept a pointer to an
  slink:XrSwapchainImageOpenGLKHR.

The OpenXR runtime must: interpret the bottom-left corner of the swapchain image
as the coordinate origin unless specified otherwise by extension functionality.

The OpenXR runtime must: interpret the swapchain images in a clip space of
positive Y pointing up, near Z plane at -1, and far Z plane at 1.
