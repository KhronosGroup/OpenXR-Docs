==== Overview

This extension enables the use of the Vulkan graphics API in an OpenXR
runtime.
Without this extension, the OpenXR runtime may not be able to use any Vulkan
swapchain images.

This extension provides the mechanisms necessary for an application to
generate a valid slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkan2KHR structure in order to
create a Vulkan-based slink:XrSession.

This extension also provides mechanisms for the application to interact with
images acquired by calling flink:xrEnumerateSwapchainImages.

In order to expose the structures, types, and functions of this extension,
you must: define dlink:XR_USE_GRAPHICS_API_VULKAN before including the
OpenXR platform header `openxr_platform.h`, in all portions of your library
or application that include it.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
This extension is intended as an alternative to `<<XR_KHR_vulkan_enable>>`,
and does not depend on it.
====

==== Initialization

When operating in Vulkan mode, the OpenXR runtime and the application will
share the Vulkan queue described in the slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkan2KHR
structure.
This section of the document describes the mechanisms this extension exposes
to ensure the shared Vulkan queue is compatible with the runtime and the
application's requirements.

===== Vulkan Version Requirements

First, a compatible Vulkan version must: be agreed upon.
To query the runtime's Vulkan API version requirements an application will
call:

[open,refpage='xrGetVulkanGraphicsRequirements2KHR',type='protos',desc='Retrieve the Vulkan version requirements for an instance and system',xrefs='XrGraphicsRequirementsVulkan2KHR']
--
include::../../../../generated/api/protos/xrGetVulkanGraphicsRequirements2KHR.txt[]

The flink:xrGetVulkanGraphicsRequirements2KHR function identifies to the
application the runtime's minimum Vulkan version requirement and the highest
known tested Vulkan version.
flink:xrGetVulkanGraphicsRequirements2KHR must: be called prior to calling
flink:xrCreateSession.
The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_GRAPHICS_REQUIREMENTS_CALL_MISSING
on calls to flink:xrCreateSession if
flink:xrGetVulkanGraphicsRequirements2KHR has not been called for the same
pname:instance and pname:systemId.

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:instance is an slink:XrInstance handle previously created with
  flink:xrCreateInstance.
* pname:systemId is an basetype:XrSystemId handle for the system which will
  be used to create a session.
* pname:graphicsRequirements is the slink:XrGraphicsRequirementsVulkan2KHR
  output structure.
****

include::../../../../generated/validity/protos/xrGetVulkanGraphicsRequirements2KHR.txt[]
--

The slink:XrGraphicsRequirementsVulkan2KHR structure populated by
flink:xrGetVulkanGraphicsRequirements2KHR is defined as:

[open,refpage='XrGraphicsRequirementsVulkan2KHR',type='structs',desc='Vulkan API version requirements',xrefs='xrGetVulkanGraphicsRequirements2KHR']
--
include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrGraphicsRequirementsVulkan2KHR.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:minApiVersionSupported is the minimum version of Vulkan that the
  runtime supports.
  Uses dlink:XR_MAKE_VERSION on major and minor API version, ignoring any
  patch version component.
* pname:maxApiVersionSupported is the maximum version of Vulkan that the
  runtime has been tested on and is known to support.
  Newer Vulkan versions might work if they are compatible.
  Uses dlink:XR_MAKE_VERSION on major and minor API version, ignoring any
  patch version component.
****

===== Vulkan Instance Creation

Second, a compatible sname:VkInstance must: be created.
The flink:xrCreateVulkanInstanceKHR entry point is a wrapper around
link:{vkRefPageRoot}/vkCreateInstance.html[vkCreateInstance] intended for
this purpose.
When called, the runtime must: aggregate the requirements specified by the
application with its own requirements and forward the sname:VkInstance
creation request to the fname:vkCreateInstance function pointer returned by
pname:pfnGetInstanceProcAddr.

[open,refpage='xrCreateVulkanInstanceKHR',type='protos',desc='Create an OpenXR compatible VkInstance',xrefs='xrCreateVulkanDeviceKHR']

===== Physical Device Selection

Third, a sname:VkPhysicalDevice must: be chosen.
Some computer systems may have multiple graphics devices, each of which may
have independent external display outputs.
The runtime must: report a sname:VkPhysicalDevice that is compatible with
the OpenXR implementation when flink:xrGetVulkanGraphicsDevice2KHR is
invoked.
The application will use this sname:VkPhysicalDevice to interact with the
OpenXR runtime.

* pname:vulkanPhysicalDevice is a pointer to a sname:VkPhysicalDevice handle
  to populate.
****

include::../../../../generated/validity/protos/xrGetVulkanGraphicsDevice2KHR.txt[]
--

parameters to flink:xrCreateVulkanInstanceKHR.

[open,refpage='XrVulkanGraphicsDeviceGetInfoKHR',type='structs',desc='Vulkan Graphics Device Get Info',xrefs='xrGetVulkanGraphicsDevice2KHR']
--
include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrVulkanGraphicsDeviceGetInfoKHR.txt[]

.Member Descriptions

  be used to create a session.
* pname:vulkanInstance is a valid Vulkan sname:VkInstance.
****

include::../../../../generated/validity/structs/XrVulkanGraphicsDeviceGetInfoKHR.txt[]
--

===== Vulkan Device Creation

Fourth, a compatible sname:VkDevice must: be created.
The flink:xrCreateVulkanDeviceKHR entry point is a wrapper around
link:{vkRefPageRoot}/vkCreateDevice.html[vkCreateDevice] intended for this
purpose.
When called, the runtime must: aggregate the requirements specified by the
application with its own requirements and forward the sname:VkDevice
creation request to the fname:vkCreateDevice function pointer returned by
pname:pfnGetInstanceProcAddr.

[open,refpage='xrCreateVulkanDeviceKHR',type='protos',desc='Create an OpenXR compatible VkDevice',xrefs='xrCreateVulkanInstanceKHR']
--
include::../../../../generated/api/protos/xrCreateVulkanDeviceKHR.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:instance is an slink:XrInstance handle previously created with
  flink:xrCreateInstance.
* pname:createInfo extensible input struct of type
  sname:XrCreateVulkanDeviceCreateInfoKHR
* pname:vulkanDevice points to a sname:VkDevice handle to populate with the
  new Vulkan device.
* pname:vulkanResult points to a sname:VkResult to populate with the result
  of the fname:vkCreateDevice operation as returned by
  pname:pfnGetInstanceProcAddr.
****

include::../../../../generated/validity/protos/xrCreateVulkanDeviceKHR.txt[]
--

The slink:XrVulkanDeviceCreateInfoKHR structure contains the input
parameters to flink:xrCreateVulkanDeviceKHR.

[open,refpage='XrVulkanDeviceCreateInfoKHR',type='structs',desc='Vulkan Device Create Info',xrefs='xrCreateVulkanDeviceKHR']
--
include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrVulkanDeviceCreateInfoKHR.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****

  be used to create a session.
* pname:pfnGetInstanceProcAddr is a function pointer to
  fname:vkGetInstanceProcAddr or a compatible entry point.
* pname:vulkanPhysicalDevice must: match flink:xrGetVulkanGraphicsDeviceKHR.
* pname:vulkanCreateInfo is the
  link:{vkRefPageRoot}/VkDeviceCreateInfo.html[sname:VkDeviceCreateInfo as
  specified by Vulkan].
* pname:vulkanAllocator is the
  link:{vkRefPageRoot}/VkAllocationCallbacks.html[sname:VkAllocationCallbacks
  as specified by Vulkan].
****

include::../../../../generated/validity/structs/XrVulkanDeviceCreateInfoKHR.txt[]
--

[open,refpage='XrVulkanDeviceCreateFlagsKHR',type='flags',desc='Vulkan Device Create Info Flags',xrefs='XrVulkanDeviceCreateInfoKHR']
--
include::../../../../generated/api/flags/XrVulkanDeviceCreateFlagsKHR.txt[]
--

If the pname:vulkanPhysicalDevice parameter does not match the output of
flink:xrGetVulkanGraphicsDeviceKHR, then the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_HANDLE_INVALID.

===== Queue Selection

Last, the application selects a sname:VkQueue from the sname:VkDevice that
has the sname:VK_QUEUE_GRAPHICS_BIT set.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The runtime may schedule work on the sname:VkQueue specified in the binding,
or it may schedule work on any hardware queue in a foreign logical device.
====

===== Vulkan Graphics Binding

When creating a Vulkan-backed slink:XrSession, the application will chain a
pointer to an slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkan2KHR to the
slink:XrSessionCreateInfo parameter of flink:xrCreateSession.
With the data collected in the previous sections, the application now has
all the necessary information to populate an
slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkan2KHR structure for session creation.

[open,refpage='XrGraphicsBindingVulkan2KHR',type='structs',desc='The graphics binding structure to be passed at session creation to use Vulkan',xrefs='xrCreateSession']
--
include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrGraphicsBindingVulkan2KHR.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.

  flink:xrCreateVulkanInstanceKHR
* pname:physicalDevice sname:VkPhysicalDevice must: match the device
  specified by flink:xrGetVulkanGraphicsDevice2KHR

Populating an slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkan2KHR structure with a member that
does not meet the requirements outlined by this extension may: result in
undefined behavior by the OpenXR runtime.

The requirements outlined in this extension only apply to the
sname:VkInstance, sname:VkDevice, sname:VkPhysicalDevice and sname:VkQueue
objects which the application wishes to associate with an
slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkan2KHR.

==== Concurrency

Vulkan requires that concurrent access to a sname:VkQueue from multiple
threads be externally synchronized.
Therefore, OpenXR functions that may access the sname:VkQueue specified in
the slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkan2KHR must: also be externally synchronized
by the OpenXR application.

The list of OpenXR functions where the OpenXR runtime may: access the
sname:VkQueue are:

* flink:xrBeginFrame
* flink:xrEndFrame
* flink:xrAcquireSwapchainImage
* flink:xrReleaseSwapchainImage

The runtime must: not access the sname:VkQueue in any OpenXR function that
is not listed above or in an extension definition.

Failure by the application to synchronize access to sname:VkQueue may:
result in undefined behavior in the OpenXR runtime.

==== Swapchain Interactions

===== Swapchain Images

When an application interacts with slink:XrSwapchainImageBaseHeader
structures in a Vulkan-backed slink:XrSession, the application can interpret
these to be slink:XrSwapchainImageVulkan2KHR structures.
These are defined as:

[open,refpage='XrSwapchainImageVulkan2KHR',type='structs',desc='Vulkan-specific swapchain image structure',xrefs='XrSwapchainImageBaseHeader']
--
include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrSwapchainImageVulkan2KHR.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:image is a valid Vulkan sname:VkImage to use.
****

If a given session was created with slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkan2KHR, the
following conditions must: apply.

* Calls to flink:xrEnumerateSwapchainImages on an slink:XrSwapchain in that
  session must: return an array of slink:XrSwapchainImageVulkan2KHR
  structures.
* Whenever an OpenXR function accepts an slink:XrSwapchainImageBaseHeader
  pointer as a parameter in that session, the runtime must: also accept a
  pointer to an slink:XrSwapchainImageVulkan2KHR.

The OpenXR runtime must: interpret the top-left corner of the swapchain
image as the coordinate origin unless specified otherwise by extension
functionality.

The OpenXR runtime must: interpret the swapchain images in a clip space of
positive Y pointing down, near Z plane at 0, and far Z plane at 1.

include::../../../../generated/validity/structs/XrSwapchainImageVulkan2KHR.txt[]
--

===== Swapchain Image Layout

When an application acquires a swapchain image by calling
flink:xrAcquireSwapchainImage in a session created using
slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkan2KHR, the OpenXR runtime must: guarantee that:

* The image has a memory layout compatible with
  ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL for color images, or
  ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL for depth images.
* The sname:VkQueue specified in slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkan2KHR has
  ownership of the image.

When an application releases a swapchain image by calling
flink:xrReleaseSwapchainImage, in a session created using
slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkan2KHR, the OpenXR runtime must: interpret the
image as:

* Having a memory layout compatible with
  ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL for color images, or
  ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL for depth images.
* Being owned by the sname:VkQueue specified in
  slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkan2KHR.
* Being referenced by command buffers submitted to the sname:VkQueue
  specified in slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkan2KHR which have not yet
  completed execution.

The application is responsible for transitioning the swapchain image back to
the image layout and queue ownership that the OpenXR runtime requires.
If the image is not in a layout compatible with the above specifications the
runtime may: exhibit undefined behavior.

===== Swapchain Flag Bits

All elink:XrSwapchainUsageFlags values passed in a session created using
slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkan2KHR must: be interpreted as follows by the
runtime, so that the returned swapchain images used by the application may
be used as if they were created with at least the specified
`VkImageUsageFlagBits` or `VkImageCreateFlagBits` set.

[cols=2*,options=header]
|===
| elink:XrSwapchainUsageFlagBits
| Corresponding Vulkan flag bit

| ename:XR_SWAPCHAIN_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT

==== Appendix

===== Questions

  1. Should the flink:xrCreateVulkanDeviceKHR and
     flink:xrCreateVulkanInstanceKHR functions have an output parameter that
     returns the combined list of parameters used to create the Vulkan
     device/instance?

    * No.
      If the application is interested in capturing this data it can set the
      pname:pfnGetInstanceProcAddr parameter to a local callback that
      captures the relevant information.
