*Overview*

This extension enables the use of the Vulkan graphics API in an OpenXR
runtime.
Without this extension, the OpenXR runtime may not be able to use any Vulkan
swapchain images.

This extension provides the mechanisms necessary for an application to
generate a valid slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkanKHR structure in order to
create a Vulkan-based slink:XrSession.
Note that during this process the application is responsible for creating
all the required Vulkan objects.

This extension also provides mechanisms for the application to interact with
images acquired by calling flink:xrEnumerateSwapchainImages.

In order to expose the structures, types, and functions of this extension,
you must: define dlink:XR_USE_GRAPHICS_API_VULKAN before including the
OpenXR platform header `openxr_platform.h`, in all portions of your library
or application that include it.

*Initialization*

Some of the requirements for creating a valid
slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkanKHR include correct initialization of a
sname:VkInstance, sname:VkPhysicalDevice, and sname:VkDevice.

A runtime may: require that the sname:VkInstance be initialized to a
specific Vulkan API version.
Additionally, the runtime may: require a set of instance extensions to be
enabled in the sname:VkInstance.
These requirements can be queried by the application using
flink:xrGetVulkanGraphicsRequirementsKHR and
flink:xrGetVulkanInstanceExtensionsKHR, respectively.

Similarly, the runtime may: require the sname:VkDevice to have a set of
device extensions enabled, which can be queried using
flink:xrGetVulkanDeviceExtensionsKHR.

In order to satisfy the sname:VkPhysicalDevice requirements, the application
can query flink:xrGetVulkanGraphicsDeviceKHR to identify the correct
sname:VkPhysicalDevice.

Populating an slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkanKHR with a sname:VkInstance,
sname:VkDevice, or sname:VkPhysicalDevice that does not meet the
requirements outlined by this extension may: result in undefined behavior by
the OpenXR runtime.

The API version, instance extension, device extension and physical device
requirements only apply to the sname:VkInstance, sname:VkDevice, and
sname:VkPhysicalDevice objects which the application wishes to associate
with an slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkanKHR.

*Concurrency*

Vulkan requires that concurrent access to a sname:VkQueue from multiple
threads be externally synchronized.
Therefore, OpenXR functions that may access the sname:VkQueue specified in
the slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkanKHR must also be externally synchronized.

The list of OpenXR functions where the OpenXR runtime may: access the
sname:VkQueue are:

* flink:xrBeginFrame
* flink:xrEndFrame
* flink:xrAcquireSwapchainImage
* flink:xrReleaseSwapchainImage

The runtime must: not access the sname:VkQueue in any OpenXR function that
is not listed above or in an extension definition.

*Swapchain Image Layout*

When an application acquires a swapchain image by calling
flink:xrAcquireSwapchainImage in a session created using
slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkanKHR, the OpenXR runtime must: guarantee that:

* The image has a memory layout compatible with
  ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL for color images, or
  ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL for depth images.
* The sname:VkQueue specified in slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkanKHR has
  ownership of the image.

When an application releases a swapchain image by calling
flink:xrReleaseSwapchainImage, in a session created using
slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkanKHR, the OpenXR runtime must: interpret the
image as:

* Having a memory layout compatible with
  ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL for color images, or
  ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL for depth images.
* Being owned by the sname:VkQueue specified in
  slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkanKHR.

The application is responsible for transitioning the swapchain image back to
the image layout and queue ownership that the OpenXR runtime requires.
If the image is not in a layout compatible with the above specifications the
runtime may: exhibit undefined behavior.

*Swapchain Flag Bits*

All elink:XrSwapchainUsageFlags values passed in a session created using
slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkanKHR must: be interpreted as follows by the
runtime, so that the returned swapchain images used by the application may
be used as if they were created with at least the specified
`VkImageUsageFlagBits` or `VkImageCreateFlagBits` set.

Some computer systems may have multiple graphics devices, each of which may
have independent external display outputs.
XR systems that connect to such graphics devices are typically connected to
a single device.
Applications need to know what graphics device the XR system is connected to
so that they can use that graphics device to generate XR images.

system, call:

flink:xrGetVulkanGraphicsDeviceKHR function identifies to the application
what graphics device (Vulkan sname:VkPhysicalDevice) needs to be used.
flink:xrGetVulkanGraphicsDeviceKHR must: be called prior to calling

flink:xrGetVulkanGraphicsDeviceKHR returns should be passed to
flink:xrCreateSession in the slink:XrGraphicsBindingVulkanKHR.
