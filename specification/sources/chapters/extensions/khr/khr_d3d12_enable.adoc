*Overview*

This extension enables the use of the D3D12 graphics API in an OpenXR
runtime.
Without this extension, the OpenXR runtime may not be able to use any D3D12
swapchain images.

This extension provides the mechanisms necessary for an application to
generate a valid slink:XrGraphicsBindingD3D12KHR structure in order to
create a D3D12-based slink:XrSession.
Note that during this process the application is responsible for creating
all the required D3D12 objects, including a graphics device and queue to be
used for rendering.

This extension also provides mechanisms for the application to interact with
images acquired by calling flink:xrEnumerateSwapchainImages.

In order to expose the structures, types, and functions of this extension,
you must: define dlink:XR_USE_GRAPHICS_API_D3D12 before including the OpenXR
platform header `openxr_platform.h`, in all portions of your library or
application that include it.

*Swapchain Image Resource State*

When an application acquires a swapchain image by calling
flink:xrAcquireSwapchainImage in a session create using
slink:XrGraphicsBindingD3D12KHR, the OpenXR runtime must: guarantee that:

* The color rendering target image has a resource state match with
  ename:D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_RENDER_TARGET
* The depth rendering target image has a resource state match with
  ename:D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_DEPTH_WRITE
* The sname:ID3D12CommandQueue specified in slink:XrGraphicsBindingD3D12KHR
  can write to the image.

When an application releases a swapchain image by calling
flink:xrReleaseSwapchainImage, in a session create using
slink:XrGraphicsBindingD3D12KHR, the OpenXR runtime must: interpret the
image as:

* Having a resource state match with
  ename:D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_RENDER_TARGET if the image is a color rendering
  target
* Having a resource state match with ename:D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_DEPTH_WRITE
  if the image is a depth rendering target
* Being available for read/write on the sname:ID3D12CommandQueue specified
  in slink:XrGraphicsBindingD3D12KHR.

The application is responsible for transitioning the swapchain image back to
the resource state and queue availability that the OpenXR runtime requires.
If the image is not in a resource state match with the above specifications
the runtime may: exhibit undefined behavior.

All elink:XrSwapchainUsageFlags values passed in a session created using
slink:XrGraphicsBindingD3D12KHR must: be interpreted as follows by the
runtime, so that the returned swapchain images used by the application may
be used as if they were created with the corresponding D3D12_BIND_FLAG flags
and heap type.
The runtime may: set additional resource flags but must: not restrict usage.

All D3D12 swapchain textures are created with D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_DEFAULT usage.

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_GRAPHICS_REQUIREMENTS_D3D12_KHR
* ename:XR_TYPE_GRAPHICS_BINDING_D3D12_KHR
* ename:XR_TYPE_SWAPCHAIN_IMAGE_D3D12_KHR

*New Enums*

*New Structures*

The following structures are provided to supply supporting runtimes the
necessary information required to work with the D3D12 API executing on
certain operating systems.

The slink:XrGraphicsBindingD3D12KHR structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrGraphicsBindingD3D12KHR.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:device is a pointer to a valid sname:ID3D12Device to use.
* pname:queue is a pointer to a valid sname:ID3D12CommandQueue to use.
****

When creating a D3D12-backed slink:XrSession, the application will provide a
pointer to an slink:XrGraphicsBindingD3D12KHR in the
slink:XrSessionCreateInfo::pname:next field of structure passed to
flink:xrCreateSession.
The D3D12 device specified in slink:XrGraphicsBindingD3D12KHR::pname:device
must: be created in accordance with the requirements retrieved through
flink:xrGetD3D12GraphicsRequirementsKHR, otherwise flink:xrCreateSession
must: return ename:XR_ERROR_GRAPHICS_DEVICE_INVALID.

* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.

* pname:texture is a pointer to a valid sname:ID3D12Texture2D to use.
****

If a given session was created with slink:XrGraphicsBindingD3D12KHR, the
following conditions must: apply.

* Calls to flink:xrEnumerateSwapchainImages on an slink:XrSwapchain in that
  session must: return an array of slink:XrSwapchainImageD3D12KHR
  structures.
* Whenever an OpenXR function accepts an slink:XrSwapchainImageBaseHeader
  pointer as a parameter in that session, the runtime must: also accept a
  pointer to an slink:XrSwapchainImageD3D12KHR.

The OpenXR runtime must: interpret the top-left corner of the swapchain
image as the coordinate origin unless specified otherwise by extension
functionality.

The OpenXR runtime must: interpret the swapchain images in a clip space of
positive Y pointing up, near Z plane at 0, and far Z plane at 1.

*New Functions*

Some computer systems may have multiple graphics devices, each of which may
have independent external display outputs.
XR systems that connect to such graphics devices are typically connected to
a single device.
Applications need to know what graphics device the XR system is connected to
so that they can use that graphics device to generate XR images.

[open,refpage='xrGetD3D12GraphicsRequirementsKHR',type='protos',desc='Retrieve the D3D12 feature level and graphics device requirements for an instance and system',xrefs='XrGraphicsRequirementsD3D12KHR xrCreateSession']
--
To retrieve the D3D12 feature level and graphics device for an instance and
system, call:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrGetD3D12GraphicsRequirementsKHR.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:instance is an slink:XrInstance handle previously created with
  flink:xrCreateInstance.
* pname:systemId is an basetype:XrSystemId handle for the system which will
  be used to create a session.
* pname:graphicsRequirements is the slink:XrGraphicsRequirementsD3D12KHR
  output structure.
****

The flink:xrGetD3D12GraphicsRequirementsKHR function identifies to the
application what graphics device (Windows LUID) needs to be used and the
minimum feature level to use.
The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_GRAPHICS_REQUIREMENTS_CALL_MISSING
(ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE may: be returned due to legacy behavior)
on calls to flink:xrCreateSession if flink:xrGetD3D12GraphicsRequirementsKHR
has not been called for the same pname:instance and pname:systemId.
The LUID and feature level that flink:xrGetD3D12GraphicsRequirementsKHR
returns must: be used to create the sname:ID3D12Device that the application
passes to flink:xrCreateSession in the slink:XrGraphicsBindingD3D12KHR.
