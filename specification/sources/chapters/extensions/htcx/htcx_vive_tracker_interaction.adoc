*Overview*

This extension defines a new interaction profile for HTC VIVE Tracker.
HTC VIVE Tracker is a generic tracked device which can be attached to
anything to make them trackable.
For example, it can be attached to user's hands or feet to track the motion
of human body.
It can also be attached to any other devices the user wants to track and
interact with.

In order to enable the functionality of this extension, you must: pass the
name of the extension into flink:xrCreateInstance via the
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo pname:enabledExtensionNames parameter as
indicated in the <<extensions>> section.

This extension allows:

* An application to enumerate the subpaths of all current connected VIVE
  trackers.
* An application to receive notification of the top level paths of a VIVE
  tracker when it is connected.

The paths of a VIVE tracker contains two paths below:

* VIVE tracker persistent path indicate a specific tracker whose lifetime
  lasts longer than an instance, which means it must: not change during its
  hardware lifetime.
  The format of this path string is unspecified and should be treated as an
  opaque string.
* VIVE tracker role path may: be constructed as
  "/user/vive_tracker_htcx/role/__ROLE_VALUE__", where __ROLE_VALUE__ takes
  one of the following values.
  The role path may: be assigned from the tool provided by the runtime and
  is dlink:XR_NULL_PATH if it has not been assigned.
  If this role path refers to more than one tracker, the runtime should:
  choose one of them to be currently active.
  The role path may: be changed during the lifetime of instance.
  Whenever it is changed, the runtime must: send event
  ename:XR_TYPE_EVENT_DATA_VIVE_TRACKER_CONNECTED_HTCX to provide the new
  role path of that tracker.
  ROLE_VALUE::
** `XR_NULL_PATH`
** `handheld_object`
** `left_foot`
** `right_foot`
** `left_shoulder`
** `right_shoulder`
** `left_elbow`
** `right_elbow`
** `left_knee`
** `right_knee`
** `waist`
** `chest`
** `camera`
** `keyboard`
* Either the persistent path or the role path can be be passed as a
  subaction path to indicate a specific tracker.
  For example, slink:XrActionCreateInfo::pname:subactionPath into function
  flink:xrCreateAction or slink:XrActionSpaceCreateInfo::pname:subactionPath
  into function flink:xrCreateActionSpace.
  Please see Example 1 below.

<<input-suggested-bindings,As with other controllers>>, if a VIVE tracker is
connected and bound to a top-level user path, or disconnected while bound to
top-level user path, the runtime must: send event
ename:XR_TYPE_EVENT_DATA_INTERACTION_PROFILE_CHANGED, and the application
may: call flink:xrGetCurrentInteractionProfile to check if the tracker is
active or not.

[NOTE]
====
The device that a tracker is attached to probably has a different motion
model than what the tracker assumes.
The motion tracking might not be as expected in this case.

*VIVE Tracker interaction profile*

Interaction profile path:

* pathname:/interaction_profiles/htc/vive_tracker_htcx

This interaction profile represents the input sources and haptics on the
VIVE Tracker.

Supported component paths:

* subpathname:/input/system/click (may: not be available for application
  use)
* subpathname:/input/menu/click
* subpathname:/input/trigger/click
* subpathname:/input/squeeze/click
* subpathname:/input/trigger/value
* subpathname:/input/trackpad/x
* subpathname:/input/trackpad/y
* subpathname:/input/trackpad/click
* subpathname:/input/trackpad/touch
* subpathname:/input/grip/pose
* subpathname:/output/haptic

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_VIVE_TRACKER_PATHS_HTCX
* ename:XR_TYPE_EVENT_DATA_VIVE_TRACKER_CONNECTED_HTCX

*New Enums*

*New Structures*

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:persistentPath is the unique path of the VIVE tracker which is
  persistent over the lifetime of the hardware.
* pname:rolePath is the path of the VIVE tracker role.
  This may: be dlink:XR_NULL_PATH if the role is not assigned.
****

The slink:XrViveTrackerPathsHTCX structure contains two paths of VIVE
tracker.

* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:paths contains two paths of the connected VIVE tracker.

Receiving the slink:XrEventDataViveTrackerConnectedHTCX event structure
indicates that a new VIVE tracker was connected or its role changed.
It is received via flink:xrPollEvent.

The flink:xrEnumerateViveTrackerPathsHTCX function is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/protos/xrEnumerateViveTrackerPathsHTCX.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:instance is an instance previously created.
* pname:pathsCapacityInput is the capacity of the pname:viveTrackerPaths, or
  `0` to retrieve the required capacity.
* pname:pathsCountOutput is a pointer to the count of
  slink:XrViveTrackerPathsHTCX pname:viveTrackerPaths written, or a pointer
  to the required capacity in the case that pname:pathsCapacityInput is
  insufficient.
* pname:viveTrackerPaths is a pointer to an array of
  slink:XrViveTrackerPathsHTCX VIVE tracker paths, but can: be code:NULL if
  pname:pathsCapacityInput is `0`.
* See <<buffer-size-parameters, Buffer Size Parameters>> chapter for a
  detailed description of retrieving the required pname:viveTrackerPaths
  size.

*Examples*

**Example 1**

This example illustrates how to locate a VIVE tracker which is attached on
the chest.
First of all, create an action with
pathname:/user/vive_tracker_htcx/role/chest as the subaction path.
Then, submit a suggested binding for that action to the role path plus
subpathname:/input/grip/pose, for the interaction profile
pathname:/interaction_profiles/htc/vive_tracker_htcx, using
flink:xrSuggestInteractionProfileBindings.
To locate the tracker, create an action space from that action, with
pathname:/user/vive_tracker_htcx/role/chest once again specified as the
subaction path.

[source,c++]

extern XrInstance instance;  // previously initialized
extern XrSession session;  // previously initialized
extern XrActionSet actionSet;  // previously initialized

// Create the action with subaction path
XrPath chestTrackerRolePath;
CHK_XR(xrStringToPath(instance, "/user/vive_tracker_htcx/role/chest",
    &chestTrackerRolePath));

XrAction chestPoseAction;
XrActionCreateInfo actionInfo{XR_TYPE_ACTION_CREATE_INFO};
actionInfo.actionType = XR_ACTION_TYPE_POSE_INPUT;
actionInfo.countSubactionPaths = 1;
actionInfo.subactionPaths = &chestTrackerRolePath;
CHK_XR(xrCreateAction(actionSet, &actionInfo, &chestPoseAction));

// Describe a suggested binding for that action and subaction path.
XrPath suggestedBindingPath;
CHK_XR(xrStringToPath(instance,
    "/user/vive_tracker_htcx/role/chest/input/grip/pose",
    &suggestedBindingPath));

std::vector<XrActionSuggestedBinding> actionSuggBindings;
XrActionSuggestedBinding actionSuggBinding;
actionSuggBinding.action = chestPoseAction;
actionSuggBinding.binding = suggestedBindingPath;
actionSuggBindings.push_back(actionSuggBinding);

// Suggest that binding for the VIVE tracker interaction profile
XrPath viveTrackerInteractionProfilePath;
CHK_XR(xrStringToPath(instance, "/interaction_profiles/htc/vive_tracker_htcx",
    &viveTrackerInteractionProfilePath));

XrInteractionProfileSuggestedBinding profileSuggBindings{
    XR_TYPE_INTERACTION_PROFILE_SUGGESTED_BINDING};
profileSuggBindings.interactionProfile =
    viveTrackerInteractionProfilePath;
profileSuggBindings.suggestedBindings =
    actionSuggBindings.data();
profileSuggBindings.countSuggestedBindings =
    (uint32_t)actionSuggBindings.size();

CHK_XR(xrSuggestInteractionProfileBindings(instance, &profileSuggBindings));

// Create action space for locating tracker
XrSpace chestTrackerSpace;
XrActionSpaceCreateInfo actionSpaceInfo{XR_TYPE_ACTION_SPACE_CREATE_INFO};
actionSpaceInfo.action = chestPoseAction;
actionSpaceInfo.subactionPath = chestTrackerRolePath;
CHK_XR(xrCreateActionSpace(session, &actionSpaceInfo, &chestTrackerSpace));

**Example 2**

This example illustrates how to handle the VIVE tracker when it is connected
or disconnected.
When a VIVE tracker is connected or its role changed, event
ename:XR_TYPE_EVENT_DATA_VIVE_TRACKER_CONNECTED_HTCX will be received.
The role path and persistent path of this tracker can be retrieved with this
event.
When a VIVE tracker is connected or disconnected, event
ename:XR_TYPE_EVENT_DATA_INTERACTION_PROFILE_CHANGED will also be received.
The slink:XrInteractionProfileState::pname:interactionProfile will be
dlink:XR_NULL_PATH if the tracker represented by that top level path is not
connected.
