==== Overview

This extension introduces the concepts and foundations for scene
understanding and spatial reasoning in OpenXR.
This unifies several related but distinct areas of functionality, which are
enumerated, configured, and interacted with in a broadly uniform way as
defined by this extension.
As this extension lacks concrete definitions of any one of these functional
areas, the formal specification text tends to be somewhat abstract.
Examples included in this extension specification text refers at times to
functionality defined in a forthcoming or hypothetical related extension for
the purpose of illustration, without inherently limiting or specifying such
additional functionality.

The broad pieces of this extension are the following:

* <<ext_spatial_entity_entity,Spatial entities>>: The functionality is
  centered around _entities_, which provide very little functionality on
  their own.
* <<ext_spatial_entity_common_components,Spatial components>>: These
  entities have _components_ associated with them that provide data and
  behaviors.
* <<ext_spatial_entity_component_types,Spatial component types>>: Each
  spatial component is of a specific _component type_, and any given
  _entity_ has at most a single _component_ of any given _component type_.
* <<ext_spatial_entity_context,Spatial context>>: All spatial entity
  interaction occurs in a _context_ after an initialization and
  configuration phase.
* <<ext_spatial_entity_capabilities_setup,Spatial capabilities>>: Spatial
  entity manipulation is broadly provided by _capabilities_.
  A capability is some unit of functionality, for example (without
  limitation) application-defined anchors, plane detection, or image
  tracking.
  Each _capability_ is typically defined in a separate extension (enabled at
  instance creation as usual) and is enabled for a specific _context_ at the
  time of creation.
* Each _capability_ is associated with a set of _component types_ for which
  _components_ are present on every entity exposed by that _capability_.
  The extension defining a _capability_ specifies which _component types_
  are mandatory for the capability ("guaranteed"), while that same extension
  or others may: specify optional: _component types_ provided by some
  potential implementations.
  Any number of _capabilities_ might provide entities with components of a
  given _component type_, which are uniformly usable no matter the
  _capability_ that produced it.
* <<ext_spatial_entity_capability_features,Spatial capability features>>:
  Further, some capabilities require configuration, and thus are
  parameterized by _capability features_.


This extension provides a mechanism for enumerating the _components_
provided by each _capability_ supported on the current system, both the
mandatory and any optional: _components_.

As some implementations may: require different degrees of parameterization
for _capabilities_, this extension provides a mechanism for enumerating the
supported _capability features_ associated with a given _capability_ in the
current system.

This extension also defines several common _components_ expected to be used
across a wide range of _capabilities_.

[[ext_spatial_entity_entity]]
==== Spatial Entity

Spatial entities are entities that exist in some space, that have various
associated data organized into components.
They may: be any of the following:

* Physical (e.g. planar surfaces like walls and floors, objects like chairs
  and bookcases, etc.)
* Virtual (e.g. content placed and shared by another application or user),
* App-defined (e.g. application marking an area as the "living room" or
  "kitchen", or marking a point as the location to place the TV etc.)

Things which are exposed via the action system, like controllers or eye
gaze, are not intended to be modeled as spatial entities.

Spatial entities in OpenXR are modeled as an _Entity-Component system_.
Each spatial entity has a set of components, and each component provides a
unique set of data and behaviors for that entity.

Spatial entities are represented by either an basetype:XrSpatialEntityIdEXT
atom or an slink:XrSpatialEntityEXT handle, details of which are provided in
the <<ext_spatial_entity_representations>> section.

[[ext_spatial_entity_component_types]]
==== Spatial Component Types

A spatial entity has one or more components which provide data or behaviors
for that entity.
See <<ext_spatial_entity_common_components>> for some common components
defined by this extension.

[open,refpage='XrSpatialComponentTypeEXT',type='enums',desc='Type of components',xrefs='xrEnumerateSpatialCapabilityComponentTypesEXT']
--
include::{generated}/api/enums/XrSpatialComponentTypeEXT.adoc[]

The elink:XrSpatialComponentTypeEXT enumeration identifies the different
types of components that the runtime may: support.

Not all component types listed are provided by this extension on its own:
some require additional extensions to be enabled at instance creation time,
as documented.

The enumerants have the following values:

include::{generated}/api/enums/XrSpatialComponentTypeEXT.comments.adoc[]
--

[[ext_spatial_entity_capabilities_setup]]
==== Spatial Capabilities and Setup

Spatial capabilities define a runtime's abilities to discover entities that
have a guaranteed set of components on them.
Applications enable the components of a spatial capability when creating the
slink:XrSpatialContextEXT, and the runtime in turn must: provide only the
enabled components on discovered entities.
e.g. If a runtime reports that one of the components for a given capability
is "semantic labels", it means the application can: enable semantic labels
via the configuration for that capability and the runtime must: only provide
the semantic label component if it is configured.

****

This function enumerates the component types that the given capability
provides on its entities in the system as configured.

The application can: use the component types enumerated in
slink:XrSpatialCapabilityComponentTypesEXT::pname:componentTypes to
understand the full set of components that the pname:systemId supports for
pname:capability and can: use this list to determine what a valid
configuration for pname:capability is when creating an
slink:XrSpatialContextEXT for it.

The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_SPATIAL_CAPABILITY_UNSUPPORTED_EXT
if pname:capability is not enumerated by
flink:xrEnumerateSpatialCapabilitiesEXT.

The runtime must: not enumerate the spatial component types whose extension
is not enabled for pname:instance.

[[ext_spatial_entity_capability_features]]
==== Spatial capability features

[open,refpage='XrSpatialCapabilityFeatureEXT',type='enums',desc='Type of spatial capability features',xrefs='xrEnumerateSpatialCapabilityFeaturesEXT']
--
include::{generated}/api/enums/XrSpatialCapabilityFeatureEXT.adoc[]

Some capabilities have parameters exposed to the application to configure
how the component data is computed by the runtime.
These dimensions of parameterization/configurability are known as capability
features.
E.g. for an image tracking capability, a runtime may: support a feature for
the application to specify whether the tracked images are stationary or not.

Providing this information to the runtime via a configuration structure
must: not change the set of component types present on the associated
entities, e.g. on the tracked image.
However, the runtime may: be able to optimize e.g. the tracking abilities of
the image tracking capability and provide a better experience to the
application.

Such features are represented by elink:XrSpatialCapabilityFeatureEXT and the
application enumerates them by using
flink:xrEnumerateSpatialCapabilityFeaturesEXT.

Each capability feature has a corresponding configuration structure to
enable it.
Such configuration structures must: be chained to
slink:XrSpatialCapabilityConfigurationBaseHeaderEXT::pname:next of the
corresponding capability.

The flink:xrEnumerateSpatialCapabilityFeaturesEXT function is defines as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrEnumerateSpatialCapabilityFeaturesEXT.adoc[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:instance is a handle to an slink:XrInstance.
* pname:systemId is the basetype:XrSystemId whose spatial capability
  features will be enumerated.
* pname:capability is the elink:XrSpatialCapabilityEXT for which the
  features will be enumerated.
* pname:capabilityFeatureCapacityInput is the capacity of the array, or 0 to
  indicate a request to retrieve the required capacity.
* pname:capabilityFeatureCountOutput is the number of features, or the
  required capacity in the case that pname:capabilityFeatureCapacityInput is
  insufficient.
* pname:capabilityFeatures is an array of
  elink:XrSpatialCapabilityFeatureEXT.
  It can: be code:NULL if pname:capabilityFeatureCapacityInput is 0.
* See the <<fundamentals-buffer-size-parameters>> section for a detailed
  description of retrieving the required pname:capabilityFeatures size.
****
The application discovers the features supported by a given system for a
elink:XrSpatialCapabilityEXT by using
flink:xrEnumerateSpatialCapabilityFeaturesEXT.

For capabilities that have features exposed, the application selects the
feature or features to enable and provides the corresponding configuration
structure in the next chain of the capability configuration structures in
slink:XrSpatialContextCreateInfoEXT::pname:capabilityConfigs.

If pname:capability is not a capability enumerated by
flink:xrEnumerateSpatialCapabilitiesEXT, the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_SPATIAL_CAPABILITY_UNSUPPORTED_EXT.

The runtime must: not enumerate the spatial capability features whose
extension is not enabled for pname:instance.

[[ext_spatial_entity_context]]
==== Spatial Context

===== Create a spatial context

[open,refpage='XrSpatialContextEXT',type='handles',desc='Represents a spatial context.']
--
include::{generated}/api/handles/XrSpatialContextEXT.adoc[]

The slink:XrSpatialContextEXT handle represents the resources for
discovering and updating some number of spatial entities in the environment
of the user.
Application can: use this handle to discover and update spatial entities
using other functions in this extension.
--

[open,refpage='xrCreateSpatialContextAsyncEXT',type='protos',desc='Create a spatial context handle.',xrefs='XrSpatialContextCreateInfoEXT xrCreateSpatialContextCompleteEXT XrSpatialContextEXT xrDestroySpatialContextEXT']
--
The flink:xrCreateSpatialContextAsyncEXT function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrCreateSpatialContextAsyncEXT.adoc[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is an slink:XrSession in which the spatial context will be
  active.
* pname:createInfo is the slink:XrSpatialContextCreateInfoEXT used to
  specify the spatial context parameters.
* pname:future is a pointer to an basetype:XrFutureEXT.
****

The application can: create an slink:XrSpatialContextEXT handle by:

* Providing slink:XrSpatialCapabilityConfigurationBaseHeaderEXT derived
  structures in slink:XrSpatialContextCreateInfoEXT::pname:capabilityConfigs
  to enable capabilities and enable components for that capability.
* Configuring the capabilities themselves with the corresponding
  configuration structures of its elink:XrSpatialCapabilityFeatureEXT.

The runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_SPATIAL_CAPABILITY_CONFIGURATION_INVALID_EXT if
slink:XrSpatialContextCreateInfoEXT::capabilityConfigCount is 0.
A spatial context handle needs at least one capability.

The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_SPATIAL_CAPABILITY_UNSUPPORTED_EXT
if any capability in the
slink:XrSpatialContextCreateInfoEXT::pname:capabilityConfigs array is not
enumerated by flink:xrEnumerateSpatialCapabilitiesEXT.

The runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_SPATIAL_CAPABILITY_CONFIGURATION_INVALID_EXT if any
slink:XrSpatialCapabilityConfigurationBaseHeaderEXT::pname:enabledComponentCount
in slink:XrSpatialContextCreateInfoEXT::pname:capabilityConfigs is 0.
A capability configuration is incomplete without a list of component types
to enable for that capability.

The runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_SPATIAL_COMPONENT_UNSUPPORTED_FOR_CAPABILITY_EXT if any
component type listed in
slink:XrSpatialCapabilityConfigurationBaseHeaderEXT::pname:enabledComponents
is not enumerated for
slink:XrSpatialCapabilityConfigurationBaseHeaderEXT::pname:capability in
flink:xrEnumerateSpatialCapabilityComponentTypesEXT.

If any of the structures in the next chain of
slink:XrSpatialContextCreateInfoEXT::pname:capabilityConfigs corresponds to
an elink:XrSpatialCapabilityFeatureEXT that is not enumerated for that
capability in flink:xrEnumerateSpatialCapabilityFeaturesEXT, the runtime
must: ignore that elink:XrSpatialCapabilityFeatureEXT structure.

The runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_SPATIAL_CAPABILITY_CONFIGURATION_INVALID_EXT if
slink:XrSpatialContextCreateInfoEXT::pname:capabilityConfigs contains
multiple structures with the same
slink:XrSpatialCapabilityConfigurationBaseHeaderEXT::pname:capability.

To ensure optimal use of system resources, the runtime may: use the
configurations provided in slink:XrSpatialContextCreateInfoEXT array to
prepare itself for spatial requests to come in.
For example, a runtime that supports plane tracking capability may: only
begin its plane tracking pipeline if a spatial context handle containing the
plane tracking capability is created by the application.
If the configured capabilities have a long warm-up time, calls to
flink:xrCreateSpatialDiscoverySnapshotAsyncEXT may: result in an empty
snapshot.
Application can: wait for slink:XrEventDataSpatialDiscoveryRecommendedEXT
before using flink:xrCreateSpatialDiscoverySnapshotAsyncEXT to be sure that
the underlying tracking services have warmed up.

If a runtime enforces a permission system to control application access to
the spatial capabilities being configured for the slink:XrSpatialContextEXT,
then the runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_PERMISSION_INSUFFICIENT if
those permissions have not been granted to this application.

This function starts an asynchronous operation and creates a corresponding
basetype:XrFutureEXT, usable with flink:xrPollFutureEXT and related
functions.
The return value of this function only indicates whether the parameters were
acceptable to schedule the asynchronous operation.
The corresponding completion function is
flink:xrCreateSpatialContextCompleteEXT, usable when a future from this
function is in the READY state, with outputs populated by that function in
the completion structure slink:XrCreateSpatialContextCompletionEXT.

spatial entities or for updating its information about known spatial
entities.
The slink:XrSpatialSnapshotEXT handle represents the immutable data for the
discovered or updated spatial entities and a subset of their components as
selected by the application.
The spatial snapshot represents a coherent view of the entities and their
component data.
Once a snapshot is created, the snapshot's data must: remain constant while
the snapshot is valid.

The application can: create any number of snapshots it wants but must: be
mindful of the memory being allocated for each new snapshot and must:
destroy the snapshots once it no longer needs them.

****

The application can: discover spatial entities by creating a discovery
snapshot by using flink:xrCreateSpatialDiscoverySnapshotAsyncEXT.

This function starts an asynchronous operation and creates a corresponding
basetype:XrFutureEXT, usable with flink:xrPollFutureEXT and related
functions.
The return value of this function only indicates whether the parameters were
acceptable to schedule the asynchronous operation.
The corresponding completion function is
flink:xrCreateSpatialDiscoverySnapshotCompleteEXT, usable when a future from
this function is in the READY state, with outputs populated by that function
in the completion structure
slink:XrCreateSpatialDiscoverySnapshotCompletionEXT.

The application can: submit multiple discovery snapshot creation requests
without needing to wait for the previous one to be completed.
The runtime may: process and complete the snapshot creation in any order.
The runtime may: delay the completion of the discovery snapshot creation to
throttle the application if it needs to reduce the use of system resources
due to power, thermal or other policies of the device.

The application can: use
slink:XrSpatialDiscoverySnapshotCreateInfoEXT::pname:componentTypes to

===== Discovery Recommendation Event

[open,refpage='XrEventDataSpatialDiscoveryRecommendedEXT',type='structs',desc='Event notifying a recommendation from the system to discover spatial entities.',xrefs='xrCreateSpatialDiscoverySnapshotAsyncEXT XrSpatialContextEXT xrPollEvent']
--
The slink:XrEventDataSpatialDiscoveryRecommendedEXT structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrEventDataSpatialDiscoveryRecommendedEXT.adoc[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:spatialContext is the slink:XrSpatialContextEXT for which discovery
  is being recommended by the runtime.
****

The application can: retrieve this event by using flink:xrPollEvent.
The application can: avoid excessive calls to
flink:xrCreateSpatialDiscoverySnapshotAsyncEXT to discover spatial entities
by waiting for this event.
If the application creates multiple discovery snapshots with the same
slink:XrSpatialDiscoverySnapshotCreateInfoEXT between two
slink:XrEventDataSpatialDiscoveryRecommendedEXT events, the resultant
snapshots may: contain the same entities and therefore the snapshot creation
and data queries would be wasteful.

Waiting for this event to create a new discovery snapshot ensures that the
application is not overloading the system with discovery requests for which
the runtime may: not return any new data and helps avoid the risk of
overusing the system resources, and getting throttled due to power or
thermal policies of the device.
This also helps create parity between runtimes that are discovering spatial
entities on the fly with live tracking and runtimes which are providing
spatial entities off of a previously recorded state (where the runtime may:
queue the discovery recommendation event only once for each
slink:XrSpatialContextEXT).

The runtime must: not queue this event for notifying the application about
changes or adjustments made to the component data of existing spatial
entities.
The application can: use the flink:xrCreateSpatialUpdateSnapshotEXT to keep
track of component data updates for the spatial entities it is interested
in.

A runtime may: queue a discovery recommendation event without waiting for
the application to first call
flink:xrCreateSpatialDiscoverySnapshotAsyncEXT.
For example, a runtime may: base the decision of queueing the discovery
recommendation event on the configuration of the slink:XrSpatialContextEXT,
its own understanding of the environment around the user (discovery of new
entities or loss of existing ones), or for hinting an appropriate discovery
request cadence to the application so as not to overload the system
resources.
The runtime may: choose to never queue this event for an
slink:XrSpatialContextEXT if no entities are found in the user's environment
throughout the lifetime of that slink:XrSpatialContextEXT.

The runtime must: not queue this event for a given pname:spatialContext
until the application completes its creation by using
flink:xrCreateSpatialContextCompleteEXT.

After the application calls flink:xrDestroySpatialContextEXT, the runtime
must: not queue any more discovery recommendation events for that spatial
context nor return any such events for that context from flink:xrPollEvent.

The flink:xrQuerySpatialComponentDataEXT function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrQuerySpatialComponentDataEXT.adoc[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:snapshot is an slink:XrSpatialSnapshotEXT previously provided by
  flink:xrCreateSpatialDiscoverySnapshotCompleteEXT or
  flink:xrCreateSpatialUpdateSnapshotEXT.
* pname:queryCondition is a pointer to an
  slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryConditionEXT structure.
* pname:queryResult is a pointer to an
  slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryResultEXT structure.
****

The application can: use flink:xrQuerySpatialComponentDataEXT to query the
component data of the entities in the snapshot by attaching a list structure
to slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryResultEXT::pname:next corresponding to
each elink:XrSpatialComponentTypeEXT in
slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryConditionEXT::pname:componentTypes.

If the application attaches a list structure to
slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryResultEXT::pname:next that does not
correspond to any of the components listed in
slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryConditionEXT::pname:componentTypes, the
runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE.

The application can: choose to attach the list structures corresponding to
only a subset of components listed in
slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryConditionEXT::pname:componentTypes.
The application can: choose to omit the list structures altogether if it
only wishes to know the ids and tracking state of the spatial entities that
satisfy the pname:queryCondition.
The runtime must: not treat the absence of list structures from the
slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryResultEXT::pname:next chain as a failure.

If slink:XrEventDataReferenceSpaceChangePending is queued and
slink:XrEventDataReferenceSpaceChangePending::pname:changeTime elapsed while
the application is querying component data from an
slink:XrSpatialSnapshotEXT, the application may: use the event data to
adjusted poses accordingly.

The runtime must: populate
slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryResultEXT::pname:entityIds only with
entities that have all the components specified in
slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryConditionEXT::pname:componentTypes.
If slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryConditionEXT::pname:componentTypeCount
is 0, the runtime must: populate pname:queryResult with all the entities
(and their tracking states) that are in the snapshot.
If additional query conditions are added to
slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryConditionEXT::pname:next, the runtime must:
treat those as an "AND" with the component types availability i.e. the
runtime must: populate slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryResultEXT::entityIds
only with entities that satisfy all of the provided conditions.
The runtime must: populate the component data in the list structures in the
same order as the entities in
slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryResultEXT::pname:entityIds i.e. the
component data at a given index in the list structure array must: correspond
to the entity at the same index.

If the tracking state for an entity is not
ename:XR_SPATIAL_ENTITY_TRACKING_STATE_TRACKING_EXT, the runtime must: not
change the data at the index corresponding to that entity in the array
contained in the list structures attached to
slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryResultEXT.

include::{generated}/validity/protos/xrQuerySpatialComponentDataEXT.adoc[]

As an example the application creates an slink:XrSpatialSnapshotEXT which
contains 5 entities, where -

* Entity 1 and 2 have components
  ename:XR_SPATIAL_COMPONENT_TYPE_BOUNDED_2D_EXT and
  ename:XR_SPATIAL_COMPONENT_TYPE_PARENT_EXT
* Entity 3 and 4 have components
  ename:XR_SPATIAL_COMPONENT_TYPE_BOUNDED_3D_EXT and
  ename:XR_SPATIAL_COMPONENT_TYPE_MESH_3D_EXT
* Entity 5 has components ename:XR_SPATIAL_COMPONENT_TYPE_BOUNDED_2D_EXT and

The elink:XrSpatialEntityTrackingStateEXT enumerates the possible spatial
entity tracking states:

The enums have the following meanings:

include::{generated}/api/enums/XrSpatialEntityTrackingStateEXT.comments.adoc[]

[[fig-EXT_spatial_entity-tracking-states]]
image::images/ext_spatial_entity_tracking_states.svg[opts="inline", align="center", title="elink:XrSpatialEntityTrackingStateEXT"]

* The runtime may: change the state of the spatial entity from
  ename:XR_SPATIAL_ENTITY_TRACKING_STATE_TRACKING_EXT to
  ename:XR_SPATIAL_ENTITY_TRACKING_STATE_PAUSED_EXT if it suspends the
  tracking of that spatial entity but has the possibility of resuming its
  tracking in the future.
  Some examples of when the runtime may: do this include (but not limited
  to) if the application loses input focus; or if the given spatial entity
  is too far from the user to be accurately tracked; or if there are too
  many entities being tracked and the runtime wants to reduce the cost of
  tracking.
  elink:XrSpatialEntityTrackingStateEXT helps the application insulate
  itself from the different tracking policies of each runtime.
* The runtime may: change the state of an entity from
  ename:XR_SPATIAL_ENTITY_TRACKING_STATE_PAUSED_EXT to
  ename:XR_SPATIAL_ENTITY_TRACKING_STATE_TRACKING_EXT or
  ename:XR_SPATIAL_ENTITY_TRACKING_STATE_STOPPED_EXT.
* The runtime must: change the state of the spatial entity from
  ename:XR_SPATIAL_ENTITY_TRACKING_STATE_TRACKING_EXT or
  ename:XR_SPATIAL_ENTITY_TRACKING_STATE_PAUSED_EXT to
  ename:XR_SPATIAL_ENTITY_TRACKING_STATE_STOPPED_EXT if the spatial entity
  is lost and its tracking will never be recovered or resumed.
  An example of such a case would be if the device loses tracking, restarts
  its tracking session but is unable to relocalize in its environment, and
  therefore treats discovered entities of this tracking session as new
  entities.
* Once the tracking state of an entity is set to
  ename:XR_SPATIAL_ENTITY_TRACKING_STATE_STOPPED_EXT, the runtime must:
  never change it any other state.
* When querying the component data of a spatial entity using
  flink:xrQuerySpatialComponentDataEXT, the runtime must: set valid data in
  the contents of the buffers provided by the application in the next chain
  of slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryResultEXT if the entity state is
  ename:XR_SPATIAL_ENTITY_TRACKING_STATE_TRACKING_EXT.
  If the entity state is ename:XR_SPATIAL_ENTITY_TRACKING_STATE_STOPPED_EXT
  or ename:XR_SPATIAL_ENTITY_TRACKING_STATE_PAUSED_EXT, the runtime must:
  not change the content of the buffers.

==== Example code

===== Application Usage

Applications typically use the spatial entity extension in the following
pattern:

* An application first enumerates the spatial capabilities of the system
  using flink:xrEnumerateSpatialCapabilitiesEXT.
  It then inspects the returned array of elink:XrSpatialCapabilityEXT and
  enumerates the components and features supported for each of those
  capabilities by using flink:xrEnumerateSpatialCapabilityComponentTypesEXT
  and flink:xrEnumerateSpatialCapabilityFeaturesEXT respectively.
  This gives the application a full picture of the components that it can:
  enable and the configurations the capability accepts.

* The application then creates one or many slink:XrSpatialContextEXT handles
  with specific spatial capability configurations, wherein the
  configurations enable & configure a specific capability in the spatial
  context, and enable & configure components for those capabilities.

* For each slink:XrSpatialContextEXT, the application waits to receive
  slink:XrEventDataSpatialDiscoveryRecommendedEXT events for that
  slink:XrSpatialContextEXT before using
  flink:xrCreateSpatialDiscoverySnapshotAsyncEXT to discover spatial
  entities.
  Once this async operation is complete, the application receives a
  slink:XrSpatialSnapshotEXT handle.

* The application queries for the entities and the component data included
  in this slink:XrSpatialSnapshotEXT by using
  flink:xrQuerySpatialComponentDataEXT.
  The application reads the latest component data of the queried entities
  from structures attached to the next chain of
  slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryResultEXT if the entity state is
  ename:XR_SPATIAL_ENTITY_TRACKING_STATE_TRACKING_EXT.

* If there are specific entities that the application identifies as
  interesting and wants to get updates for over time, it creates
  slink:XrSpatialEntityEXT handles for those entities by using
  flink:xrCreateSpatialEntityFromIdEXT.
  The application gets updates for such interesting entities by using
  flink:xrCreateSpatialUpdateSnapshotEXT and use the same
  flink:xrQuerySpatialComponentDataEXT function on the newly created
  slink:XrSpatialSnapshotEXT to get the latest component data for those
  entities.

==== Extension guidelines

* If an extension is defining a new elink:XrSpatialComponentTypeEXT which
  provides additional data about a spatial entity,
** the extension must: also define a list structure for that component which
   allows the application to pass an array to the runtime to fill out with
   the data for each of the spatial entities that satisfy
   flink:xrQuerySpatialComponentDataEXT::pname:queryCondition.
   Some examples of such list structures are
   slink:XrSpatialComponentParentListEXT and
   slink:XrSpatialComponentBounded2DListEXT.
   If the component data size is variable and requires the application to
   use <<fundamentals-buffer-size-parameters,the two-call idiom>> to query
   it, the component data should: provide an slink:XrSpatialBufferEXT for
   each variable-sized data in the list structure and it must: specify the
   elink:XrSpatialBufferTypeEXT for each buffer.
   Application can: then query the buffer data using functions defined in
   <<ext_spatial_entity_two_call_component_data>>.
   An example of such a structure is slink:XrSpatialMeshDataEXT which is
   included slink:XrSpatialComponentMesh3DListEXT.
** The extension can: also provide structures that the application can:
   chain to slink:XrSpatialComponentDataQueryConditionEXT::pname:next to
   provide additional filters for the query pertaining to the data of this
   component.
* Extensions can: define structures that extend
  slink:XrSpatialDiscoverySnapshotCreateInfoEXT to provide additional
  filters for discovery.
  The filters for creating the snapshot must: not affect the configuration
  of the spatial context, but instead are to be used to provide hints to the
  runtime on what entities and data are to be included in the snapshot as
  tracked by the current configuration of the spatial context (and therefore
  the current configuration of the underlying services).
* If an extension defines a new elink:XrSpatialCapabilityEXT,
** it should: also specify the list of elink:XrSpatialComponentTypeEXT that
   the runtimes must: provide on entities for that capability.
** it must: also provide structures derived from
   slink:XrSpatialCapabilityConfigurationBaseHeaderEXT that will allow the
   configuration of that capability.
* If an extension defines a new elink:XrSpatialCapabilityFeatureEXT, it
  must: also define a corresponding configuration structure that can: be
  chained to the next pointer of
  slink:XrSpatialCapabilityConfigurationBaseHeaderEXT, that the application
  can: use to enable the feature when creating an slink:XrSpatialContextEXT.
* An extension defining a new elink:XrSpatialCapabilityEXT should: follow
  this template for the specification -
** Overview
** Runtime support
** Configuration
** Guaranteed components
** Example Code
* An extension defining a new elink:XrSpatialComponentTypeEXT should: follow
  this template for the specification -
** Component data
** Component list structure to query data
** Configuration
* When writing an api that provides the application with a
  basetype:XrSpatialBufferIdEXT, it must: be accompanied with a
  elink:XrSpatialBufferTypeEXT to inform the application what the data type
  of the buffer is and the application can: use an appropriate
  ftext:xrGetSpatialBuffer* function to retrieve the actual contents of the
  buffer.

==== Issues

* Does a single entity always derive from solely a single capability?
** Resolved
** Answer: No.
   It is completely upto the runtime based on its own tracking capabilities
   and how it wants to represent a detected entity.
   The spec does not prescribe any particular representation of spatial
   entity except for the guaranteed components of a given capability to set
   a minimum expectation.
   A runtime may: be able to merge entities detected by separate
   capabilities and represent them as a single entity with the guaranteed
   components of all the capabilities that helped identify it.
   An example of this could be that tables can be detected by both a plane
   tracking capability and an object tracking capability, with plane
   tracking providing the ename:XR_SPATIAL_COMPONENT_TYPE_BOUNDED_2D_EXT
   component on the entity and object tracking providing
   ename:XR_SPATIAL_COMPONENT_TYPE_BOUNDED_3D_EXT.
   A certain runtime may: provide the table as 2 separate entities, each
   with their own set of guaranteed components, while certain runtimes may:
   provide just 1 entity to represent the table, and have both
   ename:XR_SPATIAL_COMPONENT_TYPE_BOUNDED_2D_EXT and
   ename:XR_SPATIAL_COMPONENT_TYPE_BOUNDED_3D_EXT on the same entity.
   What is important to note here is that a given spatial entity can have at
   most a single _component_ of any given _component type_.
   Therefore, if the component data produced by the different capabilities
   conflicts for a certain entity, the runtime must: represent them as 2
   separate entities.
