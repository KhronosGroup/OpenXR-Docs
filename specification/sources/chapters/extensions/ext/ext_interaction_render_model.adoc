==== Overview

This extension allows an application to render realistic models representing
the device or devices used by the user to interact.
It is a generalized version of functionality that has been known elsewhere
as "controller models", made generic by enumerating interaction-related
render models without filtering them, and allowing association with a
subaction path as a second lookup step.


// Non-normative note: should not contain any normative macros
[NOTE]
.Note
****
This extension is used for showing __the exact devices in use__.
It returns models that may not have been available at the time of
application creation, and thus not included in the suggested bindings.
However, models returned from this extension must conform to the
requirements in this spec, and thus are usable in a generic fashion.
If you need to customize the models or otherwise _not_ show the model as
provided, please choose assets of your own to show based on the output of
flink:xrGetCurrentInteractionProfile rather than using this extension.

* **Do not** attempt to choose a model shipped with your software based on
  model ID or UUID from this extension.
* **Do not** attempt to detect the current hardware based on render model ID
  or UUID.
* The output must be considered fully dynamic, conforming only to the
  interface explicitly described in the specification.
  Failing to do so **will** result in compatibility problems for your
  application.
  The example code in this extension demonstrates intended generic
  application behavior and should be followed closely.
****
// End of non-normative note: normative macros may resume

==== Getting Models

The design intent of this extension is to allow enumerating models _early_
and keep enumerating them as long as their future use is possible.
This is so that applications have time to load models, transcode textures,
and otherwise prepare for rendering early in the session, and so that
applications do not discard the results of that processing if it will be
needed again.
This large scope is only for enumerating the models in the first place,
however: when those models are intended to be shown is more narrowly scoped
and tightly specified, since it is less likely to be associated with a high
computational startup cost.

The base apiext:XR_EXT_render_model extension delegates several design
choices to dependent extensions, as described in
<<ext_render_model-choices>>.
For models associated with this apiext:XR_EXT_interaction_render_model
extension, the apiext:XR_EXT_render_model extension is specialized in the
following ways, addressing those delegated choices and other important
distinctions:

glTF extension behavior::: For any render model ID retrieved from this
  extension, the runtime must: support a glTF model without any required
  glTF extensions.
  Thus, the runtime must: not return
  ename:XR_ERROR_RENDER_MODEL_GLTF_EXTENSION_REQUIRED_EXT from
  flink:xrCreateRenderModelEXT for any render model ID retrieved from this
  extension.
Alpha blending::: Due to the difficulty and potential performance impact of
  implementing alpha blending correctly for multiple overlapping objects,
  applications are unlikely to be able to correctly render a model using
  alpha blending everywhere an interaction render model may appear.
  As such, the runtime should: not set `alphaMode` to `BLEND` for any
  material in a render model associated with this extension.
  Materials with `alphaMode` set to `MASK` do not pose the same challenges
  of implementation and so are suitable for use if needed.
Animation::: For any asset associated with this extension, the simple
  node-pose-visibility mechanism defined by apiext:XR_EXT_render_model in
  <<ext_render_model-animate>> is used for animation.
External references::: For any render model associated with this extension,
  the runtime must: provide a glTF asset without any references to external
  buffers and textures outside of the GLB container.
  That is, all binary data must: be embedded in the GLB binary chunk or as a
  Base64 `data:` URI.
Scenes::: For any render model associated with this extension, the runtime
  must: provide a glTF asset that contains 1 or more scene and defines the
  `scene` property to identify which scene to render.
Complexity and Optimization::: The runtime should: provide a glTF model
  optimized for real-time rendering use, with the expectation that the
  application may: render all interaction render models every frame.
  Describing such optimization is beyond the scope of this specification.
Space location::: Render models are located by a render model space, which
  does *not* correspond directly to any named pose.

.Warning
****
The runtime may: provide a lower quality glTF asset on some platforms when
certain glTF extensions are not supported.
Please consult platform specific documentation for best practices.

The flink:xrEnumerateInteractionRenderModelIdsEXT function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrEnumerateInteractionRenderModelIdsEXT.adoc[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is an slink:XrSession in which the render model will be
  valid.
* pname:getInfo exists for extensibility purposes, it is code:NULL or a
  pointer to a valid slink:XrInteractionRenderModelIdsEnumerateInfoEXT
  structure.
* pname:renderModelIdCapacityInput is the capacity of the
  pname:renderModelIds array, or 0 to indicate a request to retrieve the
  required capacity.
* pname:renderModelIdCountOutput is a pointer to the count of
  pname:renderModelIds written, or a pointer to the required capacity in the
  case that pname:renderModelIdCapacityInput is insufficient.
* pname:renderModelIds is an array of basetype:XrRenderModelIdEXT that will
  be populated with IDs for devices that are associated with actions.
* See the <<buffer-size-parameters, Buffer Size Parameters>> section for a
  detailed description of retrieving the required pname:renderModelIds size.
****

This function returns render model IDs associated with any device associated
with actions, in any action set attached with pname:session by
flink:xrAttachSessionActionSets.
There is no specific meaning for array position.
A runtime may: return values in any order, although the enumerated array
must: remain constant between calls to flink:xrSyncActions.
An application should: not assume any meaning based on array order.
Note that a runtime may: shuffle the order of IDs returned each time that
the list changes, to aid application developers in avoiding accidental
dependence on enumeration order.

An application must: not assume any given size of this array based on
suggested bindings: compatibility and user preference may: result in more
models being associated with actions than described in the suggested
bindings.
The runtime may: return more models than the number of top level user paths
in the suggested bindings due to user configuration and compatibility
rebinding.
The runtime should: continue to return model IDs corresponding to any
devices that has recently become inactive or disconnected, if they are
reasonably expected to be used again soon, to minimize the need for
applications to re-enumerate models and load assets.
Similarly, the runtime may: return model IDs for devices expected to be
used, even if they are not yet connected or active.

The runtime must: return render model IDs reflecting the actual hardware
used, which must: be independent of the currently active interaction
profile.
Accordingly, as long as the same actions within an slink:XrInstance have
suggested bindings, changing suggested bindings by adding or removing
suggested bindings for an interaction profile must: not change the
underlying assets.
Furthermore, provided that identical actions within an slink:XrInstance are
associated with suggested bindings for a specified list of glTF extensions,
the runtime must: return an identical collection of render model asset
UUIDs.

The application can: monitor for the
slink:XrEventDataInteractionRenderModelsChangedEXT event to get notified
when interaction render models need to be re-enumerated.

Changes to the collection of models enumerated (for example, due to device
change) must: only occur during a call to flink:xrSyncActions.
If the collection of models changes, the
slink:XrEventDataInteractionRenderModelsChangedEXT event must: be queued
during that call to flink:xrSyncActions to signal the need for
re-enumeration.
This implies that a runtime must: enumerate *no* models prior to the first
call to flink:xrSyncActions in a session.

Note that the UUIDs associated with the enumerated render model IDs for a
given system and list of glTF extensions may: change between instances due
to runtime changes.
Additionally, as with all atom types like basetype:XrRenderModelIdEXT, the
enumerated render model ID values associated with a logical device may:
change between sessions as render model ID atoms inherently only have
meaning within the single slink:XrSession they are enumerated from.

If an basetype:XrRenderModelIdEXT was enumerated during a call to
flink:xrEnumerateInteractionRenderModelIdsEXT during the current session,
but the set of interaction render models has now changed and that
basetype:XrRenderModelIdEXT would not enumerated by a call to
flink:xrEnumerateInteractionRenderModelIdsEXT after that change, a call to
flink:xrCreateRenderModelEXT with that basetype:XrRenderModelIdEXT must:
return ename:XR_ERROR_RENDER_MODEL_ID_INVALID_EXT.
(Note that a change in the set of interaction render models only occurs
during calls to flink:xrSyncActions, and queues an
slink:XrEventDataInteractionRenderModelsChangedEXT event if it occurs.) That
is, if an ID was previously enumerated with this function during the current
session, but is no longer enumerated due to a change in interaction render
models during an flink:xrSyncActions call, it is no longer valid to create a
slink:XrRenderModelEXT from that basetype:XrRenderModelIdEXT.

Existing slink:XrRenderModelEXT handles already created from an ID that is
no longer enumerated remain valid, but "inactive" and effectively useless.

* Locating an associated render model space must: report
  untracked/unlocatable, and therefore the model is not to be rendered.
* Calls to flink:xrGetRenderModelStateEXT may: stop providing updated data,
  as they are assumed to not be rendered and thus the model state is
  irrelevant.
* The runtime may: return ename:XR_ERROR_RENDER_MODEL_ASSET_UNAVAILABLE_EXT
  from flink:xrCreateRenderModelAssetEXT if called with the cache UUID of
  that render model, if no other active render model uses the same asset
  UUID.

Runtimes must: not enumerate a render model ID that they previously
enumerated, then no longer enumerated.
That is, if a render model ID is made inactive, it will never again become
active.
If the associated device returns, it will use a new render model ID.

A render model slink:XrRenderModelEXT created from an
basetype:XrRenderModelIdEXT enumerated by this function must: not be
visible/locatable when located by flink:xrCreateRenderModelSpaceEXT if the
session state is not ename:XR_SESSION_STATE_FOCUSED, to ensure render models
are only being rendered once per frame.

If the session is not running, the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_SESSION_NOT_RUNNING.

A render model slink:XrRenderModelEXT created from an
basetype:XrRenderModelIdEXT enumerated by this function must: be locatable
and visible if the corresponding device is locatable and there exists some
action in any action set with which the render model is associated.
This avoids having interaction render models disappear during corner cases
of application interaction, e.g. when a "menu" button present on only one
controller is the only active input.
If an application wishes to only show models for which there are active
actions, use the output of flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelSubactionPathsEXT
which enumerates subaction paths per model for the active action sets only.

Receiving this event from flink:xrPollEvent indicates that that the app
should: enumerate interaction render models (or re-enumerate them) using
flink:xrEnumerateInteractionRenderModelIdsEXT and the two-call idiom,
because the list of IDs enumerated by it has changed.
This event must: only be queued by a call to flink:xrSyncActions.
For clarity, if an application has enabled this extension, this event must:
be emitted during the first flink:xrSyncActions call if
flink:xrEnumerateInteractionRenderModelIdsEXT will enumerate any models,
because it enumerates no models prior to the first flink:xrSyncActions call.

==== Associating Models with Active Action Set Subaction Paths

An application might wish to know which models are associated with a
subaction path as used in suggested bindings, for example to adjust the
shading to highlight a controller to use in user instructions.
This operation is structured as enumerating the subaction paths for each
render model to encourage application logic that treats this data fully
generally and handles common and less common configurations uniformly.

****

flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelSubactionPathsEXT allows the application to
associate an interaction-related render model with the associated subaction
paths according to the exposed current interaction profile and active action
sets.

If pname:renderModel is valid but was not created from a render model ID
from a call to flink:xrEnumerateInteractionRenderModelIdsEXT earlier in the
current session, the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_NOT_INTERACTION_RENDER_MODEL_EXT.

The array enumerated by this function for a given render model must: not
change except during calls to flink:xrSyncActions.

// these are the key conditions
A given subaction path must: be reported for a model if and only if both of
the following are true:

* That path appears in the corresponding
  slink:XrActionCreateInfo::pname:subactionPaths for some action or actions
  associated with it in the active action sets.
* That path is used as a top-level user path for some suggested binding of
  at least one such action in the current interaction profile.

This paragraph describes implications and clarifications of the preceding
requirement.
If a given path is used as a top-level user path for a suggested binding to
an action with no subaction paths specified, or without that specific
subaction path specified, it is not sufficient to require enumerating that
path.
The runtime must: only enumerate subaction paths that are included in the
reported current interaction profile and mentioned in the corresponding
suggested bindings, even if one of the models is logically better described
by a path not used by the application.
For example, a treadmill-like interaction device with its input mapped to
actions suggested for left and right hands enumerates the paths
pathname:/user/hand/left and pathname:/user/hand/right even though
pathname:/user/treadmill is defined in the specification.
This also implies that a runtime must: return no subaction paths prior to
the first call to flink:xrSyncActions in a session, or when the most recent
call to flink:xrSyncActions did not specify any active action sets.
Additionally, the runtime must: return no subaction paths when a given
render model provides input only for actions that do not have a list of
subaction paths specified in slink:XrActionCreateInfo::pname:subactionPaths.

This function is intended for identifying models currently associated with
any actions in an active action set, as well as identifying the subaction
paths associated with the bound input.
To identify which top-level pathname:/user path is most closely associated
with the overall pose of any given interaction render model, see
flink:xrGetRenderModelPoseTopLevelUserPathEXT.
The description of that function contains a further discussion of the
differences with this function.

**Important**: The order of values returned from this function is **not**
meaningful, and the entire array should: be iterated and treated uniformly
by the application.
An application should: always be prepared for this function to return a list
of any length, up to the total number of subaction paths used in suggested
bindings.
Most functionality in OpenXR is defined to operate as if the hardware
corresponding to the current interaction profile were in use according to
the suggested bindings.
However, this function, and this extension in general, allows the
application to access aspects of the user's actual input configuration, to
provide accurate and realistic feedback to the user.
Special care is required to ensure that application code using this function
is maximally general.

==== Query Pose-Related Top Level pathname:/user Path for Model

Some applications need to know the top-level pathname:/user path most
closely associated with the overall pose of an interaction render model.
This allows an application to adjust positioning of the render model where a
render model retains its relative position to related poses and/or hand
models.

An example use case is when rendering the controller, hand model, and
elements related to poses for the player's right or left hand, while the
player has moved their hand through a virtual wall.
An application may: choose to not render these elements at their tracked
location but instead prevent movement through this obstruction.
The application will want to adjust the position of these elements in equal
measure.

[open,refpage='xrGetRenderModelPoseTopLevelUserPathEXT',type='protos',desc='Obtain the top level pathname:/user path associated with a render model id',xrefs='xrEnumerateRenderModelSubactionPathsEXT XrInteractionRenderModelIdsEnumerateInfoEXT']
--
The flink:xrGetRenderModelPoseTopLevelUserPathEXT function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrGetRenderModelPoseTopLevelUserPathEXT.adoc[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:renderModel is an slink:XrRenderModelEXT retrieved using the
  basetype:XrRenderModelIdEXT obtained through this extension.
* pname:info is parameters affecting the results of this function, including
  an array of top-level pathname:/user paths to limit results to.
* pname:topLevelUserPath is a pointer to an basetype:XrPath to which the top
  level pathname:/user path will be written.
****

This function returns the top level pathname:/user path most closely
associated with the pose of a given render model, if any, and if that path
is present in the list passed in pname:info.

A runtime must: return:
* the top level pathname:/user path from the list in pname:info that is
  *most closely* associated with the model pose as a physical reality (e.g.
  a device currently held in the user's left hand returns
  pathname:/user/hand/left), if one exists.
  Note that this requirement does provide fallback behavior.
  That is, if a model pose is related to more than one top level
  pathname:/user path, the runtime returns the path from pname:info with the
  closest association, even if it is less closely related than some other
  path *not* included in pname:info.
* dlink:XR_NULL_PATH if no such path can be determined (e.g. the
  corresponding device is currently not held by or attached to the user, or
  no path associated with the model pose was provided in pname:info).

**Note** that unlike flink:xrGetCurrentInteractionProfile, more than one
model may: report being most closely associated with a given top level
pathname:/user path.
For example, a runtime may: represent a single controller as two render
models, or a user may: have both a handheld device and a wrist-mounted
tracker.

Changes to the top level pathname:/user path state of each render model
must: only occur during a call to flink:xrSyncActions.

If pname:renderModel is valid but was not retrieved from a call to
flink:xrEnumerateInteractionRenderModelIdsEXT earlier in the current
session, the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_NOT_INTERACTION_RENDER_MODEL_EXT.

This function differs from flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelSubactionPathsEXT by
emphasizing poses and being broadly distinct from actions.
flink:xrGetRenderModelPoseTopLevelUserPathEXT focuses solely on poses
related to a top level pathname:/user path and returning only most
applicable result.
Contrast with flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelSubactionPathsEXT, which reports
all top level pathname:/user paths **being used as subaction paths** that
are associated with **actions in an active action set**.
That function is meant more for e.g. highlighting models providing input,
especially non-pose input, associated with a subaction path.
For example, the right hand might have a pie menu related action set active,
and an application could show the devices that can interact with that menu
in a highlighted way, while dimming the other models.

**Important**: An application should: always be prepared for this function
to return any top-level pathname:/user path in their list or
dlink:XR_NULL_PATH for any of the interaction render models.
Many systems will not report dlink:XR_NULL_PATH for any models, provided
that both pathname:/user/hand/left and pathname:/user/hand/right are
included on the list in pname:info, but application code must: be prepared
to handle this and that code path should: be tested manually.
Most functionality in OpenXR is defined to operate as if the hardware
corresponding to the current interaction profile were in use according to
the suggested bindings.
However, this function, and this extension in general, allows the
application to access aspects of the user's actual input configuration, to
provide accurate and realistic feedback to the user.
Special care is required to ensure that application code using this function
is maximally general.

As a demonstration of flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelSubactionPathsEXT, the
following additional code assumes that the application would like to modify
rendering (e.g. highlight) for devices that provide input to a given
subaction path, such as to emphasize which device is controlling a
currently-active teleport targeting.

==== Issues

* Should we enumerate models per subaction path? per action? or overall?
** We enumerate all models to normalize looping over an array of models of
   arbitrary length, to avoid fragility when more than one device is
   providing input for a single subaction path due to rebinding.
   (Application authors are likely to assume one model per subaction path
   unless the API is structured to avoid that assumption.)
* Given enumeration of models first, what action-related data is safe to
  expose to the application without introducing untested code paths used
  only in case of rebinding?
** Enumerating subaction paths for a model is not a problem: the runtime
   only returns subaction paths submitted by the app (so no untested code
   paths), and the mistaken assumption that only one subaction path is
   returned is less dangerous than assuming a number of models: the
   association with subaction paths is likely primarily for highlighting,
   etc.
   Incorrect processing of this data by the application produces a
   less-optimal experience, but does not result in any crash or
   incompatibility.
* Can the application associate individual actions with models or nodes in
  them?
** This is out of scope for this extension and will be provided in a
   follow-up.
   It requires more design work to achieve the working group goals.
* Should the main function only enumerate models associated with
  currently-bound and active actions?
** No, this will change for each active action set change, requiring
   frequent re-enumeration of models.
   If an application wants to display only models associated with a bound
   and active action, it can: use the results of
   flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelSubactionPathsEXT to identify them, and no
   event is needed as the application controls calling flink:xrSyncActions.
   The current design instead enumerates models associated with the union of
   all actions attached to the session.
* Does the asset corresponding to a render model ID change when the user
  switches devices, or should it trigger an event prompting the runtime to
  enumerate a new render model ID for the new device?
** An event triggers fresh enumeration retrieving a new render model ID, to
   keep one render model ID closely associated with a physical device rather
   than with a role or the inputs driven by it.
   A different type of controller is a new model ID and not just an updated
   asset for an existing one.
   Additionally, the UUID and asset for a given render model ID and list of
   extensions in a session is now defined to be immutable.
* Does flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelSubactionPathsEXT enumerate subaction
  paths in any specific order?
** No, the order is explicitly defined to have no meaning.
   An application that uses flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelSubactionPathsEXT
   should: assume there may be multiple values in this list, even though
   there may: be only one in some cases, and treat the list returned from
   flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelSubactionPathsEXT as a set.
   An application should: process all values in that list equally: e.g. if
   looking to highlight "right hand" devices, apply a highlight shader to
   all render models that contain pathname:/user/hand/right in their list
   from flink:xrEnumerateRenderModelSubactionPathsEXT no matter where it
   appears in the output.
* Can the active assets for hardware change between sessions or only
  instances?
** Assets for devices must remain fixed within a given instance.
   This is primarily unneeded implementation freedom that is restricted so
   that the conformance test suite can enforce the requirement that
   suggested bindings for additional interaction profiles, as long as they
   do not change the collection of bound actions, do not change the assets.
   It is very important for the purpose and usability of this extension that
   it returns assets related to the real hardware in use, which means it
   must: be unaffected by the interaction profile system.
   We cannot test automatically whether the hardware looks like the model,
   but if we require that the underlying assets are fixed across sessions
   within an instance, we can check that the UUID does not change based on
   the suggested bindings for a given session.
* What device render models are enumerated? Options include A: only devices
  for actions in the active action sets, B: devices associated with any
  action in any action set, C: any devices the user may interact with even
  if they do not have an associated action
** Option B is selected.
   Option A (only devices for the currently active action sets) may mean
   that the set of enumerated devices changes frequently, if not all action
   sets contain actions being supplied by every device.
   This could lead applications to have a more robust lifecycle for
   interaction render models, and well tested code paths for setup and
   teardown, but it also could result in a lot of extra overhead from this
   setup and teardown.
   Option B would enumerate a larger group of models, though not all of them
   would necessarily be applicable at all times.
   (The runtime could report not-applicable ones as not locatable when no
   actions are active.) Option C would show devices that are not necessarily
   intended for interaction (things like cameras and base stations), which
   was determined to be out of scope for this extension, though may be added
   by additional extensions with chained structure modifying this
   functionality.
* Should interaction render models remain locatable even when they do not
  have any active actions associated with them?
** Yes.
   If applications want to further filter which models to display, this is
   possible by enumerating subaction paths in the active action set for each
   model, and omitting those that enumerate no subaction paths.
