*Overview*

The +XR_EXT_conformance_automation+ allows conformance test and runtime
developers to provide hints to the underlying runtime as to what input the
test is expecting.
This enables runtime authors to automate the testing of their runtime
conformance.
This is useful for achieving rapidly iterative runtime development whilst
maintaining conformance for runtime releases.

This extension provides the following capabilities:

* The ability to toggle the active state of an input device.
* The ability to set the state of an input device button or other input
  component.
* The ability to set the location of the input device.

Applications may: call these functions at any time.
The runtime must: do its best to honor the request of applications calling
these functions, however it does not guarantee that any state change will be
reflected immediately, at all, or with the exact value that was requested.
Applications are thus advised to wait for the state change to be observable
and to not assume that the value they requested will be the value observed.
If any of the functions of this extension are called, control over input
must: be removed from the physical hardware of the system.

// This should be kept in sync with conformance_automation_warning.adoc
// which has one additional sentence at the start.
.Warning
****
This extension is **not** intended for use by non-conformance-test
applications.
A runtime may: require a runtime-specified configuration such as a
"developer mode" to be enabled before reporting support for this extension
or providing a non-stub implementation of it.

**Do not** use this functionality in a non-conformance-test application!
