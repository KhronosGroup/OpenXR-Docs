*Overview*

On platforms which support dynamically adjusting the display refresh rate,
application developers may request a specific display refresh rate in order
to improve the overall user experience, examples include:

* A video application may choose a display refresh rate which better matches
  the video content playback rate in order to achieve smoother video frames.
* An application which can support a higher frame rate may choose to render
  at the higher rate to improve the overall perceptual quality, for example,
  lower latency and less flicker.

This extension allows:

 * An application to identify what display refresh rates the session
   supports and the current display refresh rate.
 * An application to request a display refresh rate to indicate its
   preference to the runtime.
 * An application to receive notification of changes to the display refresh
   rate which are delivered via events.

In order to enable the functionality of this extension, the application
must: pass the name of the extension into flink:xrCreateInstance via the
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo::pname:enabledExtensionNames parameter as
indicated in the <<extensions>> section.

*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_EVENT_DATA_DISPLAY_REFRESH_RATE_CHANGED_FB

elink:XrResult enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_ERROR_DISPLAY_REFRESH_RATE_UNSUPPORTED_FB

*New Enums*

*New Structures*

[open,refpage='XrEventDataDisplayRefreshRateChangedFB',type='structs',desc='Event representing display refresh rate change',xrefs='xrGetDisplayRefreshRateFB']
--
Receiving the slink:XrEventDataDisplayRefreshRateChangedFB event structure
indicates that the display refresh rate has changed.

The slink:XrEventDataDisplayRefreshRateChangedFB structure is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/structs/XrEventDataDisplayRefreshRateChangedFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:fromDisplayRefreshRate is the previous display refresh rate.
* pname:toDisplayRefreshRate is the new display refresh rate.

*New Functions*

[open,refpage='xrEnumerateDisplayRefreshRatesFB',desc='Enumerates display refresh rates',type='protos',xrefs='xrGetDisplayRefreshRateFB xrRequestDisplayRefreshRateFB']
--
The flink:xrEnumerateDisplayRefreshRatesFB function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrEnumerateDisplayRefreshRatesFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is the session that enumerates the supported display refresh
  rates.
* pname:displayRefreshRateCapacityInput is the capacity of the
  pname:displayRefreshRates, or 0 to retrieve the required capacity.
* pname:displayRefreshRateCountOutput is a pointer to the count of
  code:float pname:displayRefreshRates written, or a pointer to the required
  capacity in the case that pname:displayRefreshRateCapacityInput is
  insufficient.
* pname:displayRefreshRates is a pointer to an array of code:float display
  refresh rates, but can: be code:NULL if
  pname:displayRefreshRateCapacityInput is `0`.
* See <<buffer-size-parameters, Buffer Size Parameters>> chapter for a
  detailed description of retrieving the required pname:displayRefreshRates
  size.
****

flink:xrEnumerateDisplayRefreshRatesFB enumerates the display refresh rates
supported by the current session.
Display refresh rates must: be in order from lowest to highest supported
display refresh rates.
Runtimes must: always return identical buffer contents from this enumeration
for the lifetime of the session.

[open,refpage='xrGetDisplayRefreshRateFB',desc='Get the current display refresh rate',type='protos',xrefs='xrRequestDisplayRefreshRateFB xrEnumerateDisplayRefreshRatesFB']
--
The flink:xrGetDisplayRefreshRateFB function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrGetDisplayRefreshRateFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is the slink:XrSession to query.
* pname:displayRefreshRate is a pointer to a float into which the current
  display refresh rate will be placed.
****

flink:xrGetDisplayRefreshRateFB retrieves the current display refresh rate.

[open,refpage='xrRequestDisplayRefreshRateFB',desc='Request a display refresh rate',type='protos',xrefs='xrGetDisplayRefreshRateFB xrEnumerateDisplayRefreshRatesFB']
--
The flink:xrRequestDisplayRefreshRateFB function is defined as:

include::{generated}/api/protos/xrRequestDisplayRefreshRateFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is a valid slink:XrSession handle.
* pname:displayRefreshRate is `0.0f` or a supported display refresh rate.
  Supported display refresh rates are indicated by
  flink:xrEnumerateDisplayRefreshRatesFB.
****

flink:xrRequestDisplayRefreshRateFB provides a mechanism for an application
to request the system to dynamically change the display refresh rate to the
application preferred value.
The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_DISPLAY_REFRESH_RATE_UNSUPPORTED_FB
if pname:displayRefreshRate is not either `0.0f` or one of the values
enumerated by flink:xrEnumerateDisplayRefreshRatesFB.
A display refresh rate of `0.0f` indicates the application has no
preference.

Note that this is only a request and does not guarantee the system will
switch to the requested display refresh rate.

*Issues*

Changing the display refresh rate from its system default does not come
without trade-offs.
Increasing the display refresh rate puts more load on the entire system and
can lead to thermal degradation.
Conversely, lowering the display refresh rate can provide better thermal
sustainability but at the cost of more perceptual issues, like higher
latency and flickering.
