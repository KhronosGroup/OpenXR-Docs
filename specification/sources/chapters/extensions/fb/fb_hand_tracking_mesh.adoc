*Overview*

The <<XR_EXT_hand_tracking>> extension provides a list of hand joint poses
but no mechanism to render a skinned hand mesh.

This extension allows:

* An application to get a skinned hand mesh and a bind pose skeleton that
  can be used to render a hand object driven by the joints from the
  <<XR_EXT_hand_tracking>> extension.
* Control the scale of the hand joints returned by <<XR_EXT_hand_tracking>>.


*New Object Types*

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_HAND_TRACKING_MESH_FB
* ename:XR_TYPE_HAND_TRACKING_SCALE_FB

*New Enums*

*New Structures*

The slink:XrVector4sFB structure is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/structs/XrVector4sFB.txt[]

This is a short integer, four component vector type, used for per-vertex
joint indexing for mesh skinning.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:x is the `x` component of the vector.
* pname:y is the `y` component of the vector.
* pname:z is the `z` component of the vector.
* pname:w is the `w` component of the vector.

The slink:XrHandTrackingMeshFB structure contains three sets of parallel,
application-allocated arrays: one with per-joint data, one with vertex data,
and one with index data.

The slink:XrHandTrackingMeshFB structure is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/structs/XrHandTrackingMeshFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:jointCapacityInput is the capacity of the joint data arrays in this
  structure, or `0` to indicate a request to retrieve the required capacity.
* pname:jointCountOutput is filled in by the runtime with the count of joint
  data elements written, or the required capacity in the case that any of
  pname:jointCapacityInput, pname:vertexCapacityInput, or
  pname:indexCapacityInput is `0`.
* pname:jointBindPoses is an array of poses that matches what is returned by
  flink:xrLocateHandJointsEXT which describes the hand skeleton's bind pose.
* pname:jointRadii is an array of joint radii at bind pose.
* pname:jointParents is an array of joint parents to define a bone hierarchy
  for the hand skeleton.
* pname:vertexCapacityInput is the capacity of the vertex data arrays in
  this structure, or `0` to indicate a request to retrieve the required
  capacity.
* pname:vertexCountOutput is filled in by the runtime with the count of
  vertex data elements written, or the required capacity in the case that
  any of pname:jointCapacityInput, pname:vertexCapacityInput, or
  pname:indexCapacityInput is `0`.
* pname:vertexPositions is an array of 3D vertex positions.
* pname:vertexNormals is an array of 3D vertex normals.
* pname:vertexUVs is an array of texture coordinates for this vertex.
* pname:vertexBlendIndices is an array of bone blend indices.
* pname:vertexBlendWeights is an array of bone blend weights.
* pname:indexCapacityInput is the capacity of the index data arrays in this
  structure, or `0` to indicate a request to retrieve the required capacity.
* pname:indexCountOutput is filled in by the runtime with the count of index
  data elements written, or the required capacity in the case that any of
  pname:jointCapacityInput, pname:vertexCapacityInput, or
  pname:indexCapacityInput is insufficient.
* pname:indices is an array of triangle indices.
* See the <<buffer-size-parameters> section for a detailed description of
  retrieving the required array sizes in the "struct form" as used here.
****

All arrays are application-allocated, and all may: be code:NULL if any of
pname:jointCapacityInput, pname:vertexCapacityInput, or
pname:indexCapacityInput is `0`.

The data in a fully-populated slink:XrHandTrackingMeshFB is immutable during
the lifetime of the corresponding slink:XrInstance, and is intended to be
retrieved once then used in combination with data changing per-frame
retrieved from flink:xrLocateHandJointsEXT.

[open,refpage='XrHandTrackingScaleFB',type='structs',desc='The information to query and modify hand joint overall scale',xrefs='']
--

slink:XrHandTrackingScaleFB can: be provided in the pname:next chain of
slink:XrHandJointsLocateInfoEXT when calling flink:xrLocateHandJointsEXT to
indicate to the runtime that the requested joints need to be scaled to a
different size and to query the existing scale value.
This is useful in breaking up the overall scale out of the skinning
transforms.

The slink:XrHandTrackingScaleFB structure is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/structs/XrHandTrackingScaleFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:sensorOutput is an output value: the currently measured scale as
  would be applied without passing this structure.
* pname:currentOutput is an output value: the effective output that the bind
  skeleton is getting on the current call, which may be subject to
  filtering, scaling, or validation.
* pname:overrideHandScale indicates whether the runtime should scale the
  output of this flink:xrLocateHandJointsEXT call according to
  pname:overrideValueInput
* pname:overrideValueInput is an optional input value, enabled only when the
  pname:overrideHandScale parameter is set.
  Setting this to 1.0 and setting pname:overrideHandScale to code:true will
  give the joints in mesh binding scale.

*New Functions*

[open,refpage='xrGetHandMeshFB',desc='Create a foveation profile',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrGetHandMeshFB function is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/protos/xrGetHandMeshFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:handTracker is the slink:XrHandTrackerEXT that is associated with a
  particular hand.
* pname:mesh is the slink:XrHandTrackingMeshFB output structure.
****

The flink:xrGetHandMeshFB function populates an slink:XrHandTrackingMeshFB
structure with enough information to render a skinned mesh driven by the
hand joints.
As discussed in the specification for that structure, the data enumerated by
this call is constant during the lifetime of an slink:XrInstance.
