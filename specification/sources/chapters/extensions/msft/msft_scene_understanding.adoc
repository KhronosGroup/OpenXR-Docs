*Overview*

Scene understanding provides applications with a structured, high-level
representation of the planes, meshes, and objects in the user's environment,
enabling the development of spatially-aware applications.

The application requests computation of a scene, receiving the list of scene
components observed in the environment around the user.
These scene components contain information such as:

* The type of the discovered objects (wall, floor, ceiling, or other surface
  type).
* The planes and their bounds that represent the object.
* The visual and collider triangle meshes that represent the object.

The application can use this information to reason about the structure and
location of the environment, to place holograms on surfaces, or render clues
for grounding objects.

An application typically uses this extension in the following steps:

1. Create an slink:XrSceneObserverMSFT handle to manage the system resource
   of the scene understanding compute.
2. Start the scene compute by calling flink:xrComputeNewSceneMSFT with
   slink:XrSceneBoundsMSFT to specify the scan range and a list of
   elink:XrSceneComputeFeatureMSFT features.
3. Inspect the completion of computation by polling
   flink:xrGetSceneComputeStateMSFT.
4. Once compute is completed, create an slink:XrSceneMSFT handle to the
   result by calling flink:xrCreateSceneMSFT.
5. Get properties of scene components using flink:xrGetSceneComponentsMSFT.
6. Locate scene components using flink:xrLocateSceneComponentsMSFT.

*Create a scene observer handle*

[open,refpage='XrSceneObserverMSFT',type='handles',desc='Represents a scene observer',xrefs='xrCreateSceneObserverMSFT xrDestroySceneObserverMSFT']

The slink:XrSceneObserverMSFT handle represents the resources for computing
scenes.
It maintains a correlation of scene component identifiers across multiple
scene computes.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The application should destroy the slink:XrSceneObserverMSFT handle when it
is done with scene compute and scene component data to save system power
consumption.

An application that wishes to use

non-occlusion mesh or planes.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Applications wanting to use the scene for analysis, or in a physics
simulation should set pname:consistency to
ename:XR_SCENE_COMPUTE_CONSISTENCY_SNAPSHOT_COMPLETE_MSFT in order to avoid
physics objects falling through the gaps and escaping the scene.

Setting pname:consistency to
ename:XR_SCENE_COMPUTE_CONSISTENCY_SNAPSHOT_INCOMPLETE_FAST_MSFT might speed
up the compute but it will result in gaps in the scene.

Setting pname:consistency to
ename:XR_SCENE_COMPUTE_CONSISTENCY_OCCLUSION_OPTIMIZED_MSFT should be done
when the resulting mesh will only be used to occlude virtual objects that
are behind real-world surfaces.
This mode will be most efficient and have the lowest-latency, but will
return meshes less suitable for analysis or visualization.

* ename:XR_SCENE_COMPUTE_CONSISTENCY_SNAPSHOT_COMPLETE_MSFT.
  The runtime must: return a scene that is a consistent and complete

  needed where the objects were not directly observed, in order to generate
  a watertight representation of the scene.

  that do not overlap adjacent meshes at their edges, but may: skip

  faster.
* ename:XR_SCENE_COMPUTE_CONSISTENCY_OCCLUSION_OPTIMIZED_MSFT.
  The runtime may: react to this value by computing scenes more quickly and
  reusing existing mesh buffer IDs more often to minimize app overhead, with
  potential tradeoffs such as returning meshes that are not watertight,
  meshes that overlap adjacent meshes at their edges to allow partial
  updates in the future, or other reductions in mesh quality that are less
  observable when mesh is used for occlusion only.

slink:XrSceneMeshIndicesUint32MSFT is an input/output structure for reading
32-bit indices from a scene mesh buffer.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:indexCapacityInput is the capacity of the array, or 0 to indicate a
  request to retrieve the required capacity.
* pname:indexCountOutput is a pointer to the count of indices, or a pointer
  to the required capacity in the case that pname:indexCapacityInput is
  insufficient.
* pname:indices is an array of triangle indices filled in by the runtime,
  specifying the indices of the scene mesh buffer in the vertices array.
  The triangle indices must: be returned in counter-clockwise order and
  three indices denote one triangle.
* See <<buffer-size-parameters, Buffer Size Parameters>> chapter for a
  detailed description of retrieving the required pname:indices size.

*Locate scene objects*

[open,refpage='xrLocateSceneComponentsMSFT',type='protos',desc='Locate scene components',xrefs='XrSceneComponentsLocateInfoMSFT XrSceneComponentLocationsMSFT']
--
The flink:xrLocateSceneComponentsMSFT function locates an array of scene
components to a base space at a given time.

include::../../../../generated/api/protos/xrLocateSceneComponentsMSFT.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:scene is a handle to an slink:XrSceneMSFT.
* pname:locateInfo is a pointer to slink:XrSceneComponentsLocateInfoMSFT
  describing information to locate scene components.
* pname:locations is a pointer to slink:XrSceneComponentLocationsMSFT
  receiving the returned scene component locations.
****

The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_SIZE_INSUFFICIENT if
slink:XrSceneComponentLocationsMSFT::pname:locationCount is less than
slink:XrSceneComponentsLocateInfoMSFT::pname:componentIdCount.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Similar to flink:xrLocateSpace, apps should call
flink:xrLocateSceneComponentsMSFT each frame because the location returned
by flink:xrLocateSceneComponentsMSFT in later frames may change over time as
the target space or the scene components may refine their locations.
