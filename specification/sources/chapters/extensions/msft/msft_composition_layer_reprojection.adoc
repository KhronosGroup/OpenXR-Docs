*Overview*

This extension enables an application to provide additional reprojection
information for a projection composition layer to help the runtime produce
better hologram stability and visual quality.

[open,refpage='xrEnumerateReprojectionModesMSFT',desc='Queries the supported reprojection modes.',type='protos',xrefs='XrReprojectionModeMSFT']
--
First, the application uses flink:xrEnumerateReprojectionModesMSFT to
inspect what reprojection mode the view configuration supports.

The flink:xrEnumerateReprojectionModesMSFT function returns the supported
reprojection modes of the view configuration.

include::../../../../generated/api/protos/xrEnumerateReprojectionModesMSFT.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:instance is the instance from which pname:systemId was retrieved.
* pname:systemId is the basetype:XrSystemId whose reprojection modes will be
  enumerated.
* pname:viewConfigurationType is the elink:XrViewConfigurationType to
  enumerate.
* pname:modeCapacityInput is the capacity of the array, or 0 to indicate a
  request to retrieve the required capacity.
* pname:modeCountOutput is a pointer to the count of the array, or a pointer
  to the required capacity in the case that pname:modeCapacityInput is
  insufficient.
* pname:modes is a pointer to an application-allocated array that will be
  filled with the elink:XrReprojectionModeMSFT values that are supported by
  the runtime.
  It can: be code:NULL if pname:modeCapacityInput is 0.
* See <<buffer-size-parameters, Buffer Size Parameters>> chapter for a
  detailed description of retrieving the required pname:mode size.
****

include::../../../../generated/validity/protos/xrEnumerateReprojectionModesMSFT.txt[]

A system may: support different sets of reprojection modes for different
view configuration types.
--

[open,refpage='XrCompositionLayerReprojectionInfoMSFT',type='structs',desc='The information to help reprojection of a projection layer.',xrefs='XrReprojectionModeMSFT XrCompositionLayerProjection']
--
Then, the application can: provide reprojection mode for the projection
composition layer to inform the runtime that the XR experience may: benefit
from the provided reprojection mode.

An slink:XrCompositionLayerReprojectionInfoMSFT structure can: be added to
the pname:next chain of slink:XrCompositionLayerProjection structure when
calling flink:xrEndFrame.

include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrCompositionLayerReprojectionInfoMSFT.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
* pname:reprojectionMode is an elink:XrReprojectionModeMSFT enum providing a
  hint to the reprojection mode to the corresponding projection layer.
****

include::../../../../generated/validity/structs/XrCompositionLayerReprojectionInfoMSFT.txt[]

When the application chained this structure when calling flink:xrEndFrame,
the pname:mode must: be one of the supported elink:XrReprojectionModeMSFT
returned by flink:xrEnumerateReprojectionModesMSFT function for the
corresponding elink:XrViewConfigurationType.
Otherwise, the runtime must: return error
ename:XR_ERROR_REPROJECTION_MODE_UNSUPPORTED_MSFT on the flink:xrEndFrame
function.

The runtime must: only use the given information for the corresponding frame
in flink:xrEndFrame function, and it must: not affect other frames.

[open,refpage='XrReprojectionModeMSFT',type='enums',desc='Describes the reprojection mode of a composition layer',xrefs='XrCompositionLayerReprojectionInfoMSFT']
--

The elink:XrReprojectionModeMSFT describes the reprojection mode of a
projection composition layer.

include::../../../../generated/api/enums/XrReprojectionModeMSFT.txt[]

****
* ename:XR_REPROJECTION_MODE_DEPTH_MSFT indicates the corresponding layer
  may: benefit from per-pixel depth reprojection provided by
  slink:XrCompositionLayerDepthInfoKHR to the projection layer.
  This mode is typically used for world-locked content that should remain
  physically stationary as the user walks around.

* ename:XR_REPROJECTION_MODE_PLANAR_FROM_DEPTH_MSFT indicates the
  corresponding layer may: benefit from planar reprojection and the plane
  can: be calculated from the corresponding depth information provided by
  slink:XrCompositionLayerDepthInfoKHR to the projection layer.
  This mode works better when the application knows the content is mostly
  placed on a plane.

* ename:XR_REPROJECTION_MODE_PLANAR_MANUAL_MSFT indicates that the
  corresponding layer may: benefit from planar reprojection.
  The application can: customize the plane by chaining an
  slink:XrCompositionLayerReprojectionPlaneOverrideMSFT structure to the
  same layer.
  The app can: also omit the plane override, indicating the runtime should
  use the default reprojection plane settings.
  This mode works better when the application knows the content is mostly
  placed on a plane, or when it cannot afford to submit depth information.

* ename:XR_REPROJECTION_MODE_ORIENTATION_ONLY_MSFT indicates the layer
  should be stabilized only for changes to orientation, ignoring positional
  changes.
  This mode works better for body-locked content that should follow the user
  as they walk around, such as 360-degree video.
****

When the application passes ename:XR_REPROJECTION_MODE_DEPTH_MSFT or
ename:XR_REPROJECTION_MODE_PLANAR_FROM_DEPTH_MSFT mode, it should: also
provide the depth buffer for the corresponding layer using
slink:XrCompositionLayerDepthInfoKHR in <<XR_KHR_composition_layer_depth>>
extension.
However, if the application does not submit this depth buffer, the runtime
must: apply a runtime defined fallback reprojection mode, and must: not fail
the flink:xrEndFrame function because of this missing depth.

When the application passes ename:XR_REPROJECTION_MODE_PLANAR_MANUAL_MSFT or
ename:XR_REPROJECTION_MODE_ORIENTATION_ONLY_MSFT mode, it should: avoid
providing a depth buffer for the corresponding layer using
slink:XrCompositionLayerDepthInfoKHR in <<XR_KHR_composition_layer_depth>>
extension.
However, if the application does submit this depth buffer, the runtime must:
not fail the flink:xrEndFrame function because of this unused depth data.

[open,refpage='XrCompositionLayerReprojectionPlaneOverrideMSFT',type='structs',desc='Describe the parameters to override the reprojection plane.',xrefs='']
--
When the application is confident that overriding the reprojection plane can
benefit hologram stability, it can: provide
slink:XrCompositionLayerReprojectionPlaneOverrideMSFT structure to further
help the runtime to fine tune the reprojection details.

An application can: add an
slink:XrCompositionLayerReprojectionPlaneOverrideMSFT structure to the
pname:next chain of slink:XrCompositionLayerProjection structure.

The runtime must: only use the given plane override for the corresponding
frame in flink:xrEndFrame function, and it must: not affect other frames.

include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrCompositionLayerReprojectionPlaneOverrideMSFT.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:position describes the position of the focus plane represented in
  the corresponding slink:XrCompositionLayerProjection::pname:space.

* pname:normal is a unit vector describes the focus plane normal represented
  in the corresponding slink:XrCompositionLayerProjection::pname:space.

* pname:velocity is a velocity of the position in the corresponding
  slink:XrCompositionLayerProjection::pname:space measured in meters per
  second.
****

A runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE if the pname:normal
vector deviates by more than 1% from unit length.

Adding a reprojection plane override may: benefit various reprojection modes
including ename:XR_REPROJECTION_MODE_DEPTH_MSFT,
ename:XR_REPROJECTION_MODE_PLANAR_FROM_DEPTH_MSFT and
ename:XR_REPROJECTION_MODE_PLANAR_MANUAL_MSFT.

When application choose ename:XR_REPROJECTION_MODE_ORIENTATION_ONLY_MSFT
mode, the reprojection plane override may: be ignored by the runtime.
