== View Configurations

A **view configuration** is a semantically meaningful set of one or more
views for which an application can render images.
A **primary view configuration** is a view configuration intended to be
presented to the viewer interacting with the XR application.
This distinction allows the later addition of additional views, for example
views which are intended for spectators.

A typical head-mounted VR system has a view configuration with two views,
while a typical phone-based AR system has a view configuration with a single
view.
A simple multi-wall projection-based (CAVE-like) VR system may have a view
configuration with at least one view for each display surface (wall, floor,
ceiling) in the room.

For any supported form factor, a system will support one or more primary
view configurations.
Supporting more than one primary view configuration can be useful if a
system supports a special view configuration optimized for the hardware but
also supports a more broadly used view configuration as a compatibility
fallback.

View configurations are identified with an elink:XrViewConfigurationType.

[[view_configuration_type]]
=== Primary View Configurations

[open,refpage='XrViewConfigurationType',desc='Supported view configuration type',type='enums']
--
include::../../generated/api/enums/XrViewConfigurationType.txt[]

The application selects its primary view configuration type when calling
flink:xrBeginSession, and that configuration remains constant for the
lifetime of the session, until flink:xrEndSession is called.

The number of views and the semantic meaning of each view index within a
given view configuration is well-defined, specified below for all core view
configurations.
The predefined primary view configuration types are:

.Enumerant Descriptions
****
* ename:XR_VIEW_CONFIGURATION_TYPE_PRIMARY_MONO.
  One view representing the form factor's one primary display.
  For example, an AR phone's screen.
  This configuration requires one element in
  slink:XrViewConfigurationProperties and one projection in each
  slink:XrCompositionLayerProjection layer.
* ename:XR_VIEW_CONFIGURATION_TYPE_PRIMARY_STEREO.
  Two views representing the form factor's two primary displays, which map
  to a left-eye and right-eye view.
  This configuration requires two views in
  slink:XrViewConfigurationProperties and two views in each
  slink:XrCompositionLayerProjection layer.
  View index 0 must: represent the left eye and view index 1 must: represent
  the right eye.
****

[[view_configuration_api]]
=== View Configuration API

First an application needs to select which primary view configuration it
wants to use.
If it supports multiple configurations, an application can: call
flink:xrEnumerateViewConfigurations before creating an slink:XrSession to
get a list of the view configuration types supported for a given system.

The application can: then call flink:xrGetViewConfigurationProperties and
flink:xrEnumerateViewConfigurationViews to get detailed information about
each view configuration type and its individual views.

==== xrEnumerateViewConfigurations

[open,refpage='xrEnumerateViewConfigurations',desc='Enumerates supported view configurations',type='protos',xrefs='XrViewConfigurationType']
--
The flink:xrEnumerateViewConfigurations function is defined as:

include::../../generated/api/protos/xrEnumerateViewConfigurations.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:instance is the instance from which pname:systemId was retrieved.
* pname:systemId is the basetype:XrSystemId whose view configurations will
  be enumerated.
* pname:viewConfigurationsTypeCapacityInput is the capacity of the
  pname:viewConfigurations array, or 0 to indicate a request to retrieve the
  required capacity.
* pname:viewConfigurationsTypeCountOutput is a pointer to the count of
  pname:viewConfigurations written, or a pointer to the required capacity in
  the case that pname:viewConfigurationsTypeCapacityInput is insufficient.
* pname:viewConfigurationsTypes is a pointer to an array of
  elink:XrViewConfigurationType values, but can: be code:NULL if
  pname:viewConfigurationsTypeCapacityInput is 0.
* See <<buffer-size-parameters, Buffer Size Parameters>> chapter for a
  detailed description of retrieving the required pname:viewConfigurations
  size.
****

flink:xrEnumerateViewConfigurations enumerates the view configuration types
supported by the basetype:XrSystemId.
The supported set for that system must: not change during the lifetime of
its slink:XrInstance.
The returned list of primary view configurations should: be in order from
what the runtime considered highest to lowest user preference.
Thus the first enumerated view configuration type should: be the one the
runtime prefers the application to use if possible.

Runtimes must: always return identical buffer contents from this enumeration
for the given pname:systemId and for the lifetime of the instance.

==== xrGetViewConfigurationProperties

[open,refpage='xrGetViewConfigurationProperties',desc='Gets information for a view configuration',type='protos',xrefs='XrViewConfigurationType XrViewConfigurationProperties']
--
The flink:xrGetViewConfigurationProperties function is defined as:

include::../../generated/api/protos/xrGetViewConfigurationProperties.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:instance is the instance from which pname:systemId was retrieved.
* pname:systemId is the basetype:XrSystemId whose view configuration is
  being queried.
* pname:viewConfigurationType is the elink:XrViewConfigurationType of the
  configuration to get.
* pname:configurationProperties is a pointer to view configuration
  properties to return.
****

flink:xrGetViewConfigurationProperties queries properties of an individual
view configuration.
Applications must: use one of the supported view configuration types
returned by flink:xrEnumerateViewConfigurations.
If pname:viewConfigurationType is not supported by this slink:XrInstance the
runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VIEW_CONFIGURATION_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED.

The slink:XrViewConfigurationProperties structure is defined as:
include::../../generated/api/structs/XrViewConfigurationProperties.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR.
* pname:viewConfigurationType is the elink:XrViewConfigurationType of the
  configuration.
* pname:fovMutable indicates if the view field of view can be modified by
  the application.

include::../../generated/api/protos/xrEnumerateViewConfigurationViews.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:instance is the instance from which pname:systemId was retrieved.
* pname:systemId is the basetype:XrSystemId whose view configuration is
  being queried.
* pname:viewConfigurationType is the elink:XrViewConfigurationType of the
  configuration to get.
* pname:viewCapacityInput is the capacity of the pname:views array, or 0 to
  indicate a request to retrieve the required capacity.
* pname:viewCountOutput is a pointer to the count of pname:views written, or
  a pointer to the required capacity in the case that
  pname:viewCapacityInput is 0.
* pname:views is a pointer to an array of slink:XrViewConfigurationView
  values, but can: be code:NULL if pname:viewCapacityInput is 0.
****

Each elink:XrViewConfigurationType defines the number of views associated
with it.
Applications can query more details of each view element using
flink:xrEnumerateViewConfigurationViews.
If the supplied pname:viewConfigurationType is not supported by this
slink:XrInstance and basetype:XrSystemId, the runtime must: return
ename:XR_ERROR_VIEW_CONFIGURATION_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED.

Runtimes must: always return identical buffer contents from this enumeration
for the given pname:systemId and pname:viewConfigurationType for the
lifetime of the instance.
